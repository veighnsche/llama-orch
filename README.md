# rbee (pronounced "are-bee")
**Escape dependency on big AI providers. Build your own AI infrastructure.**

rbee is an OpenAI-compatible AI orchestration platform that lets you build your own AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware. Never depend on external AI providers again.

**🎯 PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCE:** Developers who build with AI but don't want to depend on big AI providers.

**THE FEAR:** You're building complex codebases with AI assistance (Claude, GPT-4). What happens when the AI provider changes their models, shuts down, or changes pricing? Your codebase becomes unmaintainable without AI. You've created a dependency you can't control.

**THE SOLUTION:** Build AI coders from scratch using YOUR hardware. Agentic API with task-based streaming. @rbee/utils: TypeScript library for building AI agents. OpenAI-compatible = drop-in replacement. Independence from external providers.

**Current version**: `0.1.0` (68% complete - 42/62 BDD scenarios passing)  
**License**: GPL-3.0-or-later (free and open source, copyleft)  
**Target platform**: Linux with NVIDIA GPUs, Apple Silicon (Metal), CPU fallback  
**Development**: 99% AI-generated code via Character-Driven Development

## What is rbee?

### The Main Goal: Independence from Big AI Providers

**Build your own AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware:**

```bash
# Single-machine setup (localhost - zero config):
rbee infer -m llama-3-8b -p "Hello"  # Auto-starts queen, spawns worker, runs inference

# Multi-machine setup (distributed - SSH-based):
# 1. Configure hives (like ~/.ssh/config):
cat ~/.config/rbee/hives.conf
# Host gpu-computer-1
#   HostName 192.168.1.100
#   User vince
#   HivePort 9000

# 2. Install hive remotely (via SSH):
rbee hive install gpu-computer-1  # Copies binary, starts daemon via SSH

# 3. Run inference (fully automatic):
rbee infer -a gpu-computer-1 -m llama-3-8b -p "Hello"  # Queen orchestrates everything

# 2. Configure Zed IDE (or build your own AI coder)
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8500/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-rbee-token

# 3. Now your AI tooling runs on YOUR infrastructure!
# Zero external dependencies
# Models never change without your permission
# Always available (your hardware, your uptime)
# Zero ongoing costs (electricity only)
# Complete control over your AI tooling
```

**OpenAI-compatible API** means drop-in replacement for:
- Zed IDE's AI agents
- Cursor IDE
- Continue.dev
- Any tool using OpenAI SDK

**Build your own AI agents with @rbee/utils** (TypeScript library):
- File operations, LLM invocation, prompt management
- Response extraction, model definitions
- Composable utilities for agentic workflows

## What is rbee (technical)?
### Core Value Propositions
1. **Test Reproducibility**: Same seed + temp=0 → Same output (for testing validation, not a product promise)
2. **Temperature Control**: Full temperature range 0.0-2.0 for production use (product feature)
3. **Multi-Architecture Support**: NVIDIA CUDA (VRAM-only), Apple ARM (unified memory), and extensible worker adapters
4. **Multi-Node Orchestration**: Distribute models across GPU clusters
5. **Smart/Dumb Architecture**: Clean separation between decisions and execution
6. **Process Isolation**: Workers run in separate processes with isolated memory contexts
**Note**: Determinism is a testing tool, not a product guarantee. LLMs cannot guarantee deterministic behavior due to model architecture and hardware variations.

   - Thin HTTP client (talks to queen-rbee)
   - Manages queen lifecycle (auto-start with auto-update)
   - SSH-based hive installation (like Ansible)
   - Worker/model/inference commands
   - Binary crate: `rbee-keeper`, CLI command: `rbee`

2. **`queen-rbee`** — **THE BRAIN** [🚧 In Progress]
   - Port: 8500
   - Makes ALL intelligent decisions
   - Job-based architecture (everything is a job)
   - Routes operations to hives (via HTTP)
   - Inference scheduling & worker registry
   - Can embed hive logic for localhost (local-hive feature)

3. **`rbee-hive`** — **WORKER LIFECYCLE MANAGER** [✅ M0 DONE]
   - Port: 9000 (configurable)
   - Runs ON GPU machines (installed via SSH)
   - Manages workers on THAT machine only
   - Model catalog (SQLite) + backend detection

**Architecture Principles:**
- **Thin client:** `rbee` CLI is just HTTP client + queen lifecycle
- **Smart brain:** `queen-rbee` makes ALL decisions
- **Remote workers:** Hives run ON GPU machines, installed via SSH
- **Automatic:** Auto-update, auto-start, auto-orchestration
- **Extensible:** Worker variants for different backends

### Why This Architecture?
- **Clear separation**: 3 core binaries + extensible worker variants
- **queen-rbee is THE BRAIN**: Job-based architecture, routes all operations
- **rbee-hive IS a daemon**: HTTP server on port 9000 for worker lifecycle
- **Workers are stateless**: Each worker loads ONE model, can be killed anytime
- **Queen can run without GPUs**: Routes to remote workers via HTTP
- **Workers have isolated memory contexts**: Each worker owns its memory allocation
- **Testable components**: Each binary runs standalone for testing
- **Multi-architecture**: Worker variants for NVIDIA CUDA, Apple Metal, CPU

## VIBE CODED PROJECT
(THIS PART IS JUST FUTURE COPY PASTA, and something human to read)
> Hi there, My name is veighnsche (pronounced Vince). This project is **rbee** (pronounced "are-bee", formerly llama-orch) and it's nearly 99% AI generated I guess. **The main goal:** Power Zed IDE's AI agents with your homelab GPUs via OpenAI-compatible API. I mean. I don't even know how to write rust before I began with this project. I would say that I take ownership of the very high level specifications and architecture, the crate structure and the code flow, the programming language choices and what you can see in the this [`git's history`](https://github.com/veighnsche/llama-orch/commit/e32cd7660671a74917e882fdfb89c0b994dd1ced). i WANT to take FULL responsibility of any breaking bugs and security failures. However. I cannot give you that guarantee until I have fully reviewed the code details (and peer reviews would be nice.)
>
> It goes without saying that I WON'T be offended if you REFUSE to use this project due to ALL the concerns surrounding vibe coding. I understand that you're skeptical and tbh I expect that you are. I hope that the product speaks for itself eventually and feel free to audit the code. I encourage you to audit the code. I am in desperate need of human code reviewers 😓. (I have professional programming experience so I know how to handle reviews, PLUS all the code is AI generated so I won't take nits personally. EXCEPT IF YOU BASELESSLY CRITIQUE THE CODE FLOW AND ARCHITECTURE 😡. But if you spot a critical issue. I will be eternally grateful 😇. (Please read [`./SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the correct handling of critical issues.))
>
> I just wanted to prove to other skeptics and... myself. That a good programmer can vibe code beyond their normal capabilities. But TO BE FAIR. while making this project... I felt like the best scrum master in the world 😎. It was fun having [`Windsurf`](http://windsurf.com) (not sponsered but.. hey 👋) open on all my 3 screens and working on making the docs and the tests and designing the front-end while my three lovely AI developers were slaving away without any complaint and full synthetic enthusiasm.
>
> So at the time of writing this (dd/mm/yy 01/10/25). I have tried Claude 4.5 for one full day now. And I got so confident that I wrote this. Like this is some victory speech. And yes. I am imagining myself in a gif appearing in /r/prematurecelebration but. Yeah. Idk. I'm kinda seeking recognition I guess. I love my friends and they are the best their professions and carreers, but I can't celebrate some technical nuances with them you know :L. annnnnyyyy way.
>
> Please take a look around. If you have some questions. I'm open to hear about it. If you are a hater. I have been a polarizing figure my entire life. I'M SORRY OKAY :P. so yeah. (btw I know this is cringe. But it's a testament about human text in an AI generated repo. Ask an AI to be exactly my level of cringe. An LLM can't do it, because you know it will overdo the cringyness. My level of cringe is PERFECTLY human... for someone with adhd)

## Character-Driven Development (99% AI-Generated)

**rbee is built BY AI, not just WITH AI.**

### The Innovation: 6 AI Teams with Distinct Personalities

Instead of one AI doing everything, we created **6 specialized AI teams** that debate design decisions from their perspectives:

1. **Testing Team 🔍** - Obsessively paranoid, zero tolerance for false positives
2. **Security Team (auth-min) 🎭** - Trickster guardians, timing-safe everything
3. **Performance Team ⏱️** - Obsessive timekeepers, every millisecond counts
4. **Audit Logging Team 🔒** - The compliance engine, immutable trails
5. **Narration Core Team 🎀** - Observability artists, secret redaction experts
6. **Developer Experience Team 🎨** - Readability minimalists, policy hunters

**The Magic:** When teams with different priorities review the same code, they catch issues others miss. Security team catches timing attacks. Performance team catches waste. Testing team catches false positives.

**The Result:** Well-thought-out solutions examined from multiple angles.

### How It Works: TEAM-XXX Pattern

**Development workflow:**
1. Write Gherkin feature (define behavior)
2. Implement step definitions (Rust code)
3. Run BDD tests (`bdd-runner`)
4. Iterate until green
5. Handoff to next team with summary

**50+ TEAM handoffs** maintain continuity across development sessions. Each team builds on previous work. No context loss, no rework.

### What We've Proven

**Thesis:** AI can build production software if properly orchestrated

**Evidence:**
- 99% AI-generated code
- 42/62 BDD scenarios passing (68% complete)
- Clean architecture (3 core binaries + extensible workers)
- Multi-backend support (CUDA, Metal, CPU)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, BDD, property)

**This is the future of software development.** 🐝

## Security Architecture: Defense in Depth

**rbee is built with security-first principles from day one.**

### The Five Security Crates

rbee's security is built on **five specialized security crates** that work together to create defense-in-depth:

| Crate | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **auth-min** 🎭 | Authentication primitives | Timing-safe comparison, token fingerprinting, bind policy enforcement |
| **audit-logging** 🔒 | Compliance & forensics | Immutable audit trail, tamper detection, GDPR compliance (7-year retention) |
| **input-validation** 🛡️ | Injection prevention | Path traversal, SQL injection, log injection prevention |
| **secrets-management** 🔑 | Credential handling | File-based secrets (not env vars), zeroization, timing-safe verification |
| **deadline-propagation** ⏱️ | Resource protection | Deadline enforcement, timeout handling, prevents resource exhaustion |

**Together, they create defense-in-depth:** Multiple layers of security, each catching what others might miss.

### EU-Native Compliance (GDPR)

**Built-in compliance features:**
- ✅ **Immutable audit logging** - 32 event types across 7 categories
- ✅ **7-year retention** - GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001 compliant
- ✅ **Tamper detection** - Blockchain-style hash chains
- ✅ **Data residency** - EU-only worker filtering
- ✅ **GDPR endpoints** - Data export, deletion, consent tracking

**Why This Matters:**
- Pass SOC2 audits
- Legally defensible proof of actions
- Customer trust (prove correct data handling)
- EU market advantage (GDPR compliance moat)

## Architecture Overview

> **📚 For comprehensive architecture documentation, see [`.arch/README.md`](.arch/README.md)**  
> The `.arch/` folder contains a complete 10-part architectural overview covering system design, components, data flow, security, and more.

### The Four-Binary System

> **Note:** This section provides a high-level overview. For detailed component analysis, communication patterns, and implementation details, refer to [`.arch/`](.arch/) documentation.

rbee consists of **3 core binaries + worker variants** with clear responsibilities:

| Binary | Type | Port | Purpose | Status |
|--------|------|------|---------|--------|
| **rbee** | CLI | - | User interface, manages infrastructure | ✅ M0 |
| **queen-rbee** | Daemon | 8500 | Brain, routes all requests | 🚧 In Progress |
| **rbee-hive** | Daemon | 9000 | Worker lifecycle management | ✅ M0 |
| **llm-worker-rbee** | Daemon | 9300+ | LLM inference (multiple worker types) | ✅ M0 | 

### Architectural Philosophy

#### 1. Smart/Dumb Architecture
**Principle:** Clear separation between decision-making and execution.

- **queen-rbee (BRAIN)** → Makes ALL intelligent decisions (routing, scheduling, load balancing)
- **llm-worker-rbee (EXECUTOR)** → Dumb execution (load model, execute inference, stream tokens)

**Why?** Testable components, scalable, maintainable, debuggable.

#### 2. Process Isolation
**Principle:** Each worker runs in a separate process with isolated memory.

```
Worker 1 (Process A) → 8GB VRAM → llama-3-8b
Worker 2 (Process B) → 8GB VRAM → mistral-7b
Worker 3 (Process C) → 16GB RAM → qwen-0.5b (CPU)
```

**Why?** Memory safety, resource accounting, kill safety, multi-model support.

#### 3. Job-Based Architecture
**Principle:** All operations are jobs with unique IDs and SSE streams.

```
Client → POST /v1/jobs → job_id
Client → GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream → SSE events
```

**Why?** Real-time feedback, job isolation, audit trail, cancellation support.

### Binary Responsibilities

#### rbee (CLI - User Interface)
**Status:** ✅ M0 COMPLETE

**Purpose:** Primary user interface for human operators managing rbee infrastructure.

**Note:** Binary crate is `rbee-keeper`, but CLI command is `rbee` (configured via clap).

**Responsibilities:**
- Queen lifecycle management (start/stop/status/rebuild)
- Hive lifecycle management (install/start/stop/uninstall)
- Worker management (spawn/list/stop)
- Model management (download/list/delete)
- Inference testing

**Usage:**
```bash
# Zero-config localhost (automatic):
rbee infer -m llama-3-8b -p "Hello"  # Auto-starts queen, spawns worker, runs inference

# Multi-machine (SSH-based installation):
# 1. Configure hives (~/.config/rbee/hives.conf):
cat ~/.config/rbee/hives.conf
# Host gpu-computer-1
#   HostName 192.168.1.100
#   User vince
#   HivePort 9000

# 2. Install hive remotely:
rbee hive install gpu-computer-1  # SSH copy binary, start daemon

# 3. Run inference (automatic orchestration):
rbee infer -m llama-3-8b -p "Hello"  # Queen routes to best worker

# Advanced: Manual worker management (if needed):
rbee worker --hive gpu-computer-1 spawn --model llama-3-8b --device cuda:0
rbee worker list
```

#### queen-rbee (HTTP Daemon - The Brain)
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress  
**Port:** 8500

**Purpose:** Makes ALL intelligent decisions for the system.

**Responsibilities:**
- Job registry (track all operations)
- Operation routing (forwards to hive or worker)
- SSE streaming (real-time feedback)

- Worker registry (track available workers)

**Requirements:** No GPU needed

**Key Features:**
- Job-based architecture (everything is a job with SSE stream)
- Dual-mode hive forwarder (HTTP or embedded)
- Real-time narration to clients

#### rbee-hive (HTTP Daemon - Worker Lifecycle)
**Status:** ✅ M0 COMPLETE  
**Port:** 9000

**Purpose:** Worker lifecycle manager that runs ON THE GPU MACHINE.

**Key Insight:** Each GPU machine runs its own hive daemon. The hive manages workers ON THAT MACHINE ONLY.

**Responsibilities:**
- Worker spawning/stopping ON THIS MACHINE
- Model catalog and download FOR THIS MACHINE
- Device detection (CUDA/Metal/CPU) ON THIS MACHINE
- Capabilities reporting FOR THIS MACHINE
- Local job registry

**Requirements:** Runs on the GPU machine itself (NOT centrally managed)

#### llm-worker-rbee (HTTP Daemon - Executor)
**Status:** ✅ M0 COMPLETE  
**Ports:** 9300+

**Purpose:** Dumb executor for LLM inference.

**Responsibilities:**
- Load ONE model into VRAM/RAM
- Execute inference requests
- Stream tokens via SSE
- Report health status

**Requirements:** GPU (CUDA/Metal) or CPU

**Key Properties:**
- Stateless (can be killed anytime)
- Process isolated (separate memory)
- Single model per worker
- Direct HTTP API

### Request Flow: Inference Operation

> **Note:** This simplified diagram shows inference only. For the complete flow including hive setup, model provisioning, and worker spawning, see [`.arch/COMPLETE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md`](.arch/COMPLETE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Keeper as rbee<br/>(CLI)
    participant Queen as queen-rbee<br/>(8500)
    participant Worker as llm-worker<br/>(9300+)
    
    User->>Keeper: rbee infer --prompt "Hello"
    
    Note over Keeper: Create Operation::Infer
    
    Keeper->>Queen: POST /v1/jobs<br/>{operation: Infer}
    Queen-->>Keeper: {job_id: "uuid-123"}
    
    Keeper->>Queen: GET /v1/jobs/uuid-123/stream
    
    Note over Queen: 1. Check if worker exists<br/>2. If not: trigger model download<br/>3. If not: spawn worker<br/>4. Direct HTTP to worker
    
    Queen->>Worker: POST /v1/infer<br/>{prompt, params}<br/>(DIRECT - bypasses hive!)
    
    Worker-->>Queen: SSE: token stream
    Queen-->>Keeper: SSE: relay tokens
    
    Keeper->>User: Display tokens<br/>in real-time
    
    Worker-->>Queen: SSE: [DONE]
    Queen-->>Keeper: SSE: [DONE]
```

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **Inference bypasses hive:** Queen sends requests DIRECTLY to worker for performance
- **Worker heartbeats:** Workers send heartbeats directly to queen (TEAM-261)
- **Model provisioning:** If model missing, queen triggers download via hive
- **Worker spawning:** If no worker available, queen spawns via hive
### Worker Lifecycle: Spawn Flow

> **Note:** This shows worker spawning only. For the complete flow from clean install, see [`.arch/COMPLETE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md`](.arch/COMPLETE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Keeper as rbee
    participant Queen as queen-rbee
    participant Hive as rbee-hive
    participant Worker as llm-worker
    
    User->>Keeper: rbee worker spawn<br/>--model llama-3-8b --device cuda:0
    
    Keeper->>Queen: POST /v1/jobs<br/>{operation: WorkerSpawn}
    Queen-->>Keeper: {job_id: "uuid-456"}
    
    Keeper->>Queen: GET /v1/jobs/uuid-456/stream
    
    Note over Queen: Forward to hive via HTTP
    
    Queen->>Hive: POST /v1/jobs<br/>{operation: WorkerSpawn}
    Hive-->>Queen: {job_id: "hive-789"}
    
    Queen->>Hive: GET /v1/jobs/hive-789/stream
    
    Note over Hive: 1. Check if model exists<br/>2. If not: Download from HF<br/>3. Check if worker binary exists<br/>4. If not: Download/build binary<br/>5. Detect GPU capabilities<br/>6. Spawn worker process
    
    Hive->>Worker: spawn llm-worker-rbee<br/>--model ... --port 9300
    
    Note over Worker: 1. Load model into VRAM<br/>2. Start HTTP server<br/>3. Send heartbeat to queen
    
    Worker->>Queen: POST /v1/worker-heartbeat<br/>(DIRECT - TEAM-261)
    
    Hive-->>Queen: SSE: Worker spawned
    Queen-->>Keeper: SSE: Worker spawned
    
    Keeper->>User: ✅ Worker active on 9300
```

**Key Steps:**
1. **Model Check:** Hive checks if model exists locally
2. **Model Download:** If missing, downloads from Hugging Face
3. **Binary Resolution:** Checks for worker binary (target/release → download → build)
4. **GPU Detection:** Uses gpu-info crate to detect CUDA/Metal/CPU
5. **Worker Spawn:** Spawns process with model path and device
6. **Model Loading:** Worker loads model into VRAM/RAM
7. **Heartbeat:** Worker sends heartbeat DIRECTLY to queen (not through hive)

## API Overview

### Job-Based Architecture

rbee uses a **job-based architecture** where ALL operations (hive management, worker spawning, inference) are jobs with SSE streams.

### HTTP Endpoints

#### queen-rbee (Port 8500)

**Job Submission:**
- `POST /v1/jobs` — Submit operation, returns `{job_id}`
- `GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream` — SSE stream of job events

**Operations:**
```json
// Hive operations
{"operation": {"HiveInstall": {"alias": "localhost", ...}}}
{"operation": {"HiveStart": {"alias": "localhost"}}}
{"operation": {"HiveStop": {"alias": "localhost"}}}
{"operation": {"HiveStatus": {"alias": "localhost"}}}
{"operation": {"HiveUninstall": {"alias": "localhost"}}}

// Worker operations (forwarded to hive)
{"operation": {"WorkerSpawn": {"hive_id": "localhost", "model": "llama-3-8b", ...}}}
{"operation": {"WorkerList": {"hive_id": "localhost"}}}
{"operation": {"WorkerStop": {"worker_id": "uuid"}}}

// Model operations (forwarded to hive)
{"operation": {"ModelDownload": {"hive_id": "localhost", "model": "llama-3-8b"}}}
{"operation": {"ModelList": {"hive_id": "localhost"}}}

// Inference operations (direct to worker)
{"operation": {"Infer": {"prompt": "Hello", "model": "llama-3-8b", ...}}}
```

#### rbee-hive (Port 9000)

**Same API structure:**
- `POST /v1/jobs` — Submit operation (worker/model ops only)
- `GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream` — SSE stream

#### llm-worker-rbee (Ports 9300+)

**Direct Inference:**
- `POST /v1/infer` — Submit inference request, SSE stream response
- `GET /health` — Worker health check
### SSE Streaming Format

**Narration Events:**
```
data: {"event": "hive_health_check", "message": "Checking hive health...", "timestamp": "..."}
data: {"event": "hive_start", "message": "🚀 Starting hive...", "timestamp": "..."}
data: {"event": "hive_start", "message": "✅ Hive started", "timestamp": "..."}
data: [DONE]
```

**Inference Stream:**
```
data: Hello
data:  world
data: !
data: [DONE]
```

**Error Events:**
```json
data: {"error": "Hive not found: unknown-hive", "timestamp": "..."}
data: [DONE]
```
### Request Lifecycle (Inference)

> **Complete Flow:** For the full end-to-end flow from clean install to inference completion, see [`.arch/COMPLETE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md`](.arch/COMPLETE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md). This includes hive lifecycle, model provisioning, worker spawning, and direct inference.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as rbee
    participant Queen as queen-rbee
    participant Worker as llm-worker
    
    CLI->>Queen: POST /v1/jobs<br/>{operation: Infer}
    Queen-->>CLI: {job_id: "uuid"}
    
    CLI->>Queen: GET /v1/jobs/uuid/stream
    
    Note over Queen: 1. Schedule to worker<br/>2. Select worker by model<br/>3. DIRECT HTTP (bypass hive!)
    
    Queen->>Worker: POST /v1/infer<br/>(DIRECT - not through hive)
    
    loop Token Generation
        Worker-->>Queen: SSE: token
        Queen-->>CLI: SSE: token
    end
    
    Worker-->>Queen: SSE: [DONE]
    Queen-->>CLI: SSE: [DONE]
```

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Direct inference:** Queen → Worker (bypasses hive for performance)
- **Hot path:** Inference is critical, so we eliminate the hive hop
- **Latency:** ~1-2ms overhead (vs ~5-10ms if going through hive)
---

cargo run --bin rbee-hive
# Hive listening on 0.0.0.0:9000

# On control node:
cargo run --bin queen-rbee
# Queen listening on http://localhost:8500

# Register remote hive:
rbee hive install gpu-machine-1 \
  --url http://192.168.1.100:9000

# Spawn worker on remote machine:
rbee worker --hive gpu-machine-1 spawn \

## Development Workflow

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This is a Rust project. Do NOT write shell scripts for product features. See [NO_SHELL_SCRIPTS.md](NO_SHELL_SCRIPTS.md).

rbee follows strict **Spec → Contract → Tests → Code** discipline:
1. **Spec**: Define requirements in `.specs/` with stable IDs (ORCH-3xxx)
2. **Contract**: Update OpenAPI/types in `contracts/`
3. **Tests**: Write BDD scenarios, unit tests, integration tests
4. **Code**: Implement to satisfy tests and specs
### Key Principles
- **No backwards compatibility before v1.0** — Breaking changes are expected
- **Test reproducibility** — Identical inputs + temp=0 yield identical outputs (for testing only)
- **** — Tests emit artifacts (NDJSON, JSON, seeds) to `.proof_bundle/`
- **Metrics contract** — All metrics align with `.specs/metrics/otel-prom.md`
- **Zero dead code** — Remove unused code immediately (see `AGENTS.md`)
See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for complete repository guidelines.
