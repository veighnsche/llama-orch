# Proof-Bundle — Home Profile Smoke (39_SMOKE)

Status: Draft
Owner: @llama-orch-maintainers
Date: 2025-09-26

## Scope
Home Profile Smoke validates the reference workstation readiness. This suite is executed at the repo level, not within `libs/proof-bundle`. However, smoke scripts may use this crate to emit artifacts in a consistent layout.

## Expectations When Used by Smoke Scripts
- Use `ProofBundle::for_type(TestType::Smoke)` to open `home-profile-smoke/<run_id>/`.
- Emit required artifacts (see template):
  - `environment.md` — hardware/OS summary
  - `smoke_report.md` — summary of probes, commands, endpoints
  - `logs_redacted/` — relevant redacted logs
- Enforce headers per PB-1012 automatically:
  - Markdown: start with `# AUTOGENERATED: Proof Bundle` (use `write_markdown_with_header`)
  - NDJSON (if any): first metadata record (use `append_ndjson_autogen_meta`)
  - JSON (if any): include sibling `.meta` (use `write_json_with_meta`)
- Respect envs `LLORCH_PROOF_DIR` (to point under CI workspace) and `LLORCH_RUN_ID`.

## Non-Goals
- No smoke tests are authored inside this crate.

## Links
- Central type guide: `/.docs/testing/types/smoke.md`
- Template: `/.proof_bundle/templates/home-profile-smoke/README.md`
- Spec: `/.specs/00_proof-bundle.md` (PB-1012)
- Contracts: `/.specs/10_contracts.md`
