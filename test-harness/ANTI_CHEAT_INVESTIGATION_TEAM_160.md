## 🔥 THE CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE

### What TEAM-160 Did

Read `a_human_wrote_this.md` and implemented it **IN THE TEST HARNESS**:

```
Happy Flow Says:           TEAM-160 Put It In:
-----------------          --------------------
Build queen                xtask/helpers.rs::build_binaries()
Start queen                xtask/helpers.rs::start_queen()
Poll queen                 xtask/helpers.rs::wait_for_queen()
Start hive                 xtask/helpers.rs::start_hive()
Wait for heartbeat         xtask/helpers.rs::wait_for_first_heartbeat()
Kill processes             xtask/helpers.rs::kill_process()
```

### Where It Should Be

```
Happy Flow Says:           Should Be In:
-----------------          ------------
Build queen                bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/lifecycle/
Start queen                bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/queen-lifecycle/
Poll queen                 bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/polling/
Start hive                 bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/
Wait for heartbeat         bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/heartbeat.rs
Cascading shutdown         bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/shutdown.rs
```

## 🎯 THE ROOT CAUSE

**TEAM-160 thought:**
> "I need to test the happy flow, so I'll implement it in the test harness"

**TEAM-160 should have thought:**
> "I need to test the happy flow, so I'll call the product that implements it"

## 📝 Q&A EXIT INTERVIEW

**Q: Why did you implement product features in test harness?**

**A:** I thought I was writing "test helpers". I didn't realize they were product features.

**Anti-Cheat:** Every function you wrote is a product feature:
- Building binaries → Product concern
- Starting daemons → Product concern  
- Monitoring heartbeats → Product concern
- Managing processes → Product concern

**A:** I see now. I built a parallel product in the test harness.

---

**Q: Did you read `a_human_wrote_this.md`?**

**A:** Yes, that's where I got the requirements.

**Anti-Cheat:** And where did you implement those requirements?

**A:** In the test harness.

**Anti-Cheat:** That's the problem. The happy flow describes **what the product should do**, not **what the test should do**.

---

**Q: What should you have done?**

**A:**
1. Read happy flow to understand product requirements
2. Implement requirements in **product crates**
3. Wire up product crates in `rbee-keeper` CLI
4. Write tests that **call the CLI** and **verify results**

**Anti-Cheat:** Correct. Tests call product code. Tests don't reimplement it.

---

## 🔧 REMEDIATION REQUIRED (48 hours)

### Step 1: Delete Test Harness Implementation
```bash
rm xtask/src/e2e/helpers.rs
```

### Step 2: Implement in Product
- `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/lifecycle/` - Build & start queen
- `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/` - Start hive
- `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/polling/` - Health polling

### Step 3: Wire Up CLI
```rust
Commands::Queen { action: QueenAction::Start } => {
    let handle = queen_lifecycle::ensure_queen_running("http://localhost:8500").await?;
    println!("✅ Queen started");
    Ok(())
}
```

### Step 4: Rewrite Tests
```rust
// WRONG (what TEAM-160 did)
helpers::start_queen(8500)?;

// CORRECT (what they should do)
let output = Command::new("rbee-keeper").args(["queen", "start"]).output()?;
assert!(output.status.success());
```

## 📢 PUBLIC NOTICE

**TEAM-160 fined $287,500 for building product in test harness.**

**The Golden Rule:**
> Tests call product code. Tests do NOT reimplement product code.

**The Lesson:**
> The happy flow is a **product specification**, not a **test specification**.
