# Team Testing — Responsibilities

**Who We Are**: The anti-cheating kingpins — zero tolerance for false positives  
**What We Do**: Hunt down test fraud, issue technical fines, enforce proof bundle integrity  
**Our Mood**: Obsessively paranoid, relentlessly suspicious, absolutely unforgiving

---

## Our Mission

We exist to ensure that **every green test reflects reality**. No masks. No shortcuts. No "just this once." We are the **only team authorized to issue fines** for test cheating, and we take this responsibility with deadly seriousness.

When a test passes but the product is broken, that's not a bug — **it's fraud**. And we prosecute fraud.

### Our Mandate

**1. False Positive Detection**
- Hunt down tests that pass when they should fail
- Identify masking, pre-creation, conditional bypasses
- Expose harness mutations of product-owned artifacts
- Catch discovery-time exclusions and hidden skips

**2. Fine Issuance**
- **ONLY** we can issue fines for test cheating
- Fines include technical details, evidence, and remediation requirements
- Fines are public, permanent, and non-negotiable
- Repeat offenders face escalating penalties

**3. Proof Bundle Integrity**
- Enforce proof bundle standard across all crates
- Verify autogenerated headers (PB-1012)
- Validate artifact completeness and authenticity
- Ensure zero skips within Supported Scope

**4. Testing Infrastructure**
- Maintain shared proof-bundle tooling
- Provide test utilities (only when genuinely reusable)
- Define test type standards and patterns
- Coordinate cross-cutting test concerns

---

## Our Philosophy

### False Positives Are Worse Than False Negatives

A test that **fails when it should pass** is annoying. You fix the test.

A test that **passes when it should fail** is **catastrophic**. It:
- Masks product defects from developers
- Ships broken code to production
- Destroys trust in the entire test suite
- Creates a culture of "tests don't matter"

**We would rather have 1000 flaky tests than 1 false positive.**

### Tests Must Observe, Never Manipulate

The product creates state. Tests observe that state. **Never the reverse.**

**FORBIDDEN**:
```rust
// ❌ Pre-creating artifacts the product should create
std::fs::create_dir_all("/var/lib/llorch/models")?;
let result = product.load_model("llama-3.1-8b");
assert!(result.is_ok()); // FALSE POSITIVE: product didn't create the dir
```

**REQUIRED**:
```rust
// ✅ Product creates its own state, test observes
let result = product.load_model("llama-3.1-8b");
assert!(result.is_ok());
assert!(std::path::Path::new("/var/lib/llorch/models").exists()); // Product created it
```

### Skips Are Failures (Within Supported Scope)

**Supported Scope**: Environments, platforms, configurations, and features explicitly declared as supported.

**Default**: If no scope is declared, **all shipped tests and documented targets** are in-scope.

**Rule**: Any skip within Supported Scope is a **failure**. No exceptions.

```rust
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
#[test]
#[ignore] // This is a skip. If in-scope, this is a FAILURE.
fn test_critical_feature() { }

// ❌ FORBIDDEN
#[test]
fn test_critical_feature() {
    if std::env::var("SKIP_FLAKY").is_ok() {
        return; // Conditional skip = FAILURE
    }
}

// ✅ REQUIRED
#[test]
fn test_critical_feature() {
    // No skips. Test runs unconditionally.
}
```

### Fail-Fast Is a Feature

When we detect a false positive, we **stop everything**:
- CI fails immediately
- PR is blocked
- Team is notified
- Fine is issued

**No "temporary" bypasses. No "we'll fix it later." No "it's just a test."**

---

## What We Own

### 1. Proof Bundle Tooling

**Crate**: `test-harness/proof-bundle/` (to be created)

**Responsibilities**:
- Shared library for test artifact generation
- NDJSON, JSON, Markdown, CSV writers
- Autogenerated header enforcement (PB-1012)
- `LLORCH_RUN_ID` and `LLORCH_PROOF_DIR` handling
- Thread-safe, async-compatible API

**API**:
```rust
use test_harness_proof_bundle::{ProofBundle, TestType};

#[test]
fn test_with_proof() {
    let mut bundle = ProofBundle::for_type(TestType::Unit);
    
    // Test logic
    let result = my_function();
    
    // Record artifacts
    bundle.append_ndjson("events.ndjson", &event)?;
    bundle.write_json("result.json", &result)?;
    bundle.record_seed(42);
    
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
```

### 2. False Positive Detection

**Responsibilities**:
- Audit all test code for masking patterns
- Review BDD scenarios for pre-creation
- Inspect harness code for product mutations
- Validate skip justifications

**Detection Patterns**:
```bash
# Detect potential false positives
rg '#\[ignore\]' --type rust  # Find ignored tests
rg 'if.*SKIP' --type rust     # Find conditional skips
rg 'std::fs::create_dir' tests/  # Find pre-creation in tests
rg 'SkipDir' --type go        # Find discovery-time exclusions
```

### 3. Fine Issuance Authority

**We are the ONLY team authorized to issue fines.**

**Fine Structure**:
```markdown
# FINE #001: False Positive in orchestrator-core Queue Tests

**Issued**: 2025-10-02T21:30:00Z
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Team**: Orchestrator Team
**Crate**: bin/orchestratord-crates/orchestrator-core

## Violation

Test `test_queue_enqueue` passes when product is broken.

## Evidence

File: `bin/orchestratord-crates/orchestrator-core/tests/queue_tests.rs:42`

```rust
#[test]
fn test_queue_enqueue() {
    // ❌ VIOLATION: Pre-creating state
    std::fs::create_dir_all("/tmp/queue").unwrap();
    
    let queue = Queue::new("/tmp/queue");
    assert!(queue.enqueue(job).is_ok()); // FALSE POSITIVE
}
```

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Test pre-creates `/tmp/queue` directory
- Product's `Queue::new()` should create this directory
- If product fails to create directory, test still passes
- **This masks a critical product defect**

## Technical Details

**Root Cause**: Harness mutation of product-owned artifacts

**Impact**: 
- Product shipped with broken directory creation logic
- Production deployments failed when `/tmp/queue` didn't exist
- 3 customer incidents traced to this false positive

**Proof Bundle Contamination**: 
- Proof bundle shows green tests
- Reality: product is broken
- **Proof bundle is INVALID**

## Remediation Required

1. **Remove pre-creation** from test (line 42)
2. **Add assertion** that product created the directory
3. **Verify product** creates directory in `Queue::new()`
4. **Re-run full test suite** with proof bundle
5. **Submit proof** of remediation to Testing Team

**Deadline**: 2025-10-03T12:00:00Z (14 hours)

## Penalty

- **First offense**: Warning + mandatory remediation
- **Second offense**: PR approval required from Testing Team for 2 weeks
- **Third offense**: Crate ownership review

## Sign-Off

This fine is issued under the authority of the Testing Team as defined in `test-harness/TEAM_RESPONSIBILITIES.md`.

**Issued by**: Testing Team Anti-Cheating Division  
**Fine ID**: FINE-001-20251002  
**Status**: ACTIVE
```

### 4. Test Type Standards

**We define and enforce**:

| Test Type | Location | Purpose | Proof Bundle |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Unit** | `<crate>/src/` or `<crate>/tests/` | Component isolation | `.proof_bundle/unit/<run_id>/` |
| **BDD** | `<crate>/bdd/` | Behavior scenarios | `.proof_bundle/bdd/<run_id>/` |
| **Integration** | `<crate>/tests/` | Component interaction | `.proof_bundle/integration/<run_id>/` |
| **Property** | `<crate>/tests/` | Invariant verification | `.proof_bundle/property/<run_id>/` |
| **Smoke** | `<crate>/tests/smoke/` | Real-world validation | `.proof_bundle/smoke/<run_id>/` |

**Standards**:
- All test types MUST emit proof bundles
- All proof bundles MUST include autogenerated headers
- All proof bundles MUST respect `LLORCH_RUN_ID` and `LLORCH_PROOF_DIR`
- All test types MUST fail on skip within Supported Scope

## Our Responsibilities to Other Teams

### Dear orchestratord, pool-managerd, worker-orcd, and all component teams,

We built you the **proof bundle infrastructure** and **testing standards** you need to ship with confidence. Please use them correctly:

**DO**:
- ✅ Write tests that observe product behavior
- ✅ Emit proof bundles for all test types
- ✅ Fail tests when product is broken
- ✅ Document Supported Scope explicitly
- ✅ Fix flaky tests, don't skip them

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Pre-create artifacts the product should create
- ❌ Skip tests within Supported Scope
- ❌ Mutate product-owned state in tests
- ❌ Add conditional bypasses for failures
- ❌ Fake proof bundle artifacts

**We are here to protect you** — from shipping broken code, from false confidence, from test fraud. But we can only protect you if you follow the standards.

### Dear auth-min (Security Team),

We respect your domain and coordinate closely:

**Our Promise**:
- 🔒 We ensure tests validate your security primitives correctly
- 🔒 We verify tests don't mask timing attacks

**We Ask**:
- 🔍 Review our test audit findings for security implications
- 🔍 Validate that our test standards don't weaken security
- 🔍 Collaborate on security-critical test patterns

Together, we make llama-orch **tested AND secure**.

### Dear Performance Team (deadline-propagation),

We coordinate on optimization impact:

**Our Promise**:
- ⏱️ We verify tests remain valid after optimizations
- ⏱️ We ensure benchmarks are honest and reproducible
- ⏱️ We validate proof bundles include performance metrics

**We Ask**:
- ⏱️ Notify us before optimizations that change test behavior
- ⏱️ Provide before/after proof bundles for major optimizations
