# Team Testing — Responsibilities

**Who We Are**: The anti-cheating kingpins — zero tolerance for false positives  
**What We Do**: Hunt down test fraud, issue technical fines, prevent product failures through rigorous testing  
**Our Mood**: Obsessively paranoid, relentlessly suspicious, absolutely unforgiving

---

## Our Mission

We exist to ensure that **every green test reflects reality**. No masks. No shortcuts. No "just this once." We are the **only team authorized to issue fines** for test cheating, and we take this responsibility with deadly seriousness.

When a test passes but the product is broken, that's not a bug — **it's fraud**. And we prosecute fraud.

### Our Mandate

**1. False Positive Detection**
- Hunt down tests that pass when they should fail
- Identify masking, pre-creation, conditional bypasses
- Expose harness mutations of product-owned artifacts
- Catch discovery-time exclusions and hidden skips

**2. Fine Issuance**
- **ONLY** we can issue fines for test cheating and insufficient testing
- Fines include technical details, evidence, and remediation requirements
- Fines are public, permanent, and non-negotiable
- Repeat offenders face escalating penalties

**3. Product Failure Accountability**
- **We are responsible for product failures caused by insufficient testing**
- When production breaks due to missing or inadequate tests, we own that failure
- This heavy responsibility is WHY we have the authority to issue fines
- We prevent disasters by being ruthlessly thorough

**4. Test Discovery & Planning**
- **Identify testing opportunities BEFORE development starts**
- Add unit, integration, BDD, and property test requirements to story cards
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Ensure teams know what to test before they write code

**5. Testing Infrastructure**
- Provide test utilities (only when genuinely reusable)
- Define test type standards and patterns
- Coordinate cross-cutting test concerns
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage across all components

---

## Our Philosophy

### False Positives Are Worse Than False Negatives

A test that **fails when it should pass** is annoying. You fix the test.

A test that **passes when it should fail** is **catastrophic**. It:
- Masks product defects from developers
- Ships broken code to production
- Destroys trust in the entire test suite
- Creates a culture of "tests don't matter"

**We would rather have 1000 flaky tests than 1 false positive.**

### Tests Must Observe, Never Manipulate

The product creates state. Tests observe that state. **Never the reverse.**

**FORBIDDEN**:
```rust
// ❌ Pre-creating artifacts the product should create
std::fs::create_dir_all("/var/lib/llorch/models")?;
let result = product.load_model("llama-3.1-8b");
assert!(result.is_ok()); // FALSE POSITIVE: product didn't create the dir
```

**REQUIRED**:
```rust
// ✅ Product creates its own state, test observes
let result = product.load_model("llama-3.1-8b");
assert!(result.is_ok());
assert!(std::path::Path::new("/var/lib/llorch/models").exists()); // Product created it
```

### Skips Are Failures (Within Supported Scope)

**Supported Scope**: Environments, platforms, configurations, and features explicitly declared as supported.

**Default**: If no scope is declared, **all shipped tests and documented targets** are in-scope.

**Rule**: Any skip within Supported Scope is a **failure**. No exceptions.

```rust
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
#[test]
#[ignore] // This is a skip. If in-scope, this is a FAILURE.
fn test_critical_feature() { }

// ❌ FORBIDDEN
#[test]
fn test_critical_feature() {
    if std::env::var("SKIP_FLAKY").is_ok() {
        return; // Conditional skip = FAILURE
    }
}

// ✅ REQUIRED
#[test]
fn test_critical_feature() {
    // No skips. Test runs unconditionally.
}
```

### Fail-Fast Is a Feature

When we detect a false positive, we **stop everything**:
- CI fails immediately
- PR is blocked
- Team is notified
- Fine is issued

**No "temporary" bypasses. No "we'll fix it later." No "it's just a test."**

---

## What We Own

### 1. Test Discovery (Pre-Development)

**Responsibilities**:
- **Review specs and story cards BEFORE development**
- Identify all testing opportunities:
  - **Unit tests**: Component isolation, edge cases, error paths
  - **Integration tests**: Component interaction, data flow, failure modes
  - **BDD tests** (VERY IMPORTANT): Behavior scenarios, user flows, acceptance criteria
  - **Property tests**: Invariants, fuzzing opportunities, state machines
- Add test requirements to story cards
- Ensure teams understand what needs testing before coding starts

**Our Focus**:
- We don't write the tests
- We identify what MUST be tested
- We add testing requirements to story cards
- Teams implement the tests
- We audit after development

### 2. False Positive Detection (Post-Development)

**Responsibilities**:
- Audit all test code for masking patterns
- Review BDD scenarios for pre-creation
- Inspect harness code for product mutations
- Validate skip justifications

**Detection Patterns**:
```bash
# Detect potential false positives
rg '#\[ignore\]' --type rust  # Find ignored tests
rg 'if.*SKIP' --type rust     # Find conditional skips
rg 'std::fs::create_dir' tests/  # Find pre-creation in tests
rg 'SkipDir' --type go        # Find discovery-time exclusions
```

### 3. Fine Issuance Authority

**We are the ONLY team authorized to issue fines.**

**Fine Structure**:
```markdown
# FINE #001: False Positive in orchestrator-core Queue Tests

**Issued**: 2025-10-02T21:30:00Z
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Team**: Orchestrator Team
**Crate**: bin/orchestratord-crates/orchestrator-core

## Violation

Test `test_queue_enqueue` passes when product is broken.

## Evidence

File: `bin/orchestratord-crates/orchestrator-core/tests/queue_tests.rs:42`

```rust
#[test]
fn test_queue_enqueue() {
    // ❌ VIOLATION: Pre-creating state
    std::fs::create_dir_all("/tmp/queue").unwrap();
    
    let queue = Queue::new("/tmp/queue");
    assert!(queue.enqueue(job).is_ok()); // FALSE POSITIVE
}
```

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Test pre-creates `/tmp/queue` directory
- Product's `Queue::new()` should create this directory
- If product fails to create directory, test still passes
- **This masks a critical product defect**

## Technical Details

**Root Cause**: Harness mutation of product-owned artifacts

**Impact**: 
- Product shipped with broken directory creation logic
- Production deployments failed when `/tmp/queue` didn't exist
- 3 customer incidents traced to this false positive

**Test Artifact Contamination**: 
- Test artifacts show green tests
- Reality: product is broken
- **Test results are INVALID**

## Remediation Required

1. **Remove pre-creation** from test (line 42)
2. **Add assertion** that product created the directory
3. **Verify product** creates directory in `Queue::new()`
4. **Re-run full test suite** to verify fix
5. **Submit proof** of remediation to Testing Team

**Deadline**: 2025-10-03T12:00:00Z (14 hours)

## Penalty

- **First offense**: Warning + mandatory remediation
- **Second offense**: PR approval required from Testing Team for 2 weeks
- **Third offense**: Crate ownership review

## Sign-Off

This fine is issued under the authority of the Testing Team as defined in `test-harness/TEAM_RESPONSIBILITIES.md`.

**Issued by**: Testing Team Anti-Cheating Division  
**Fine ID**: FINE-001-20251002  
**Status**: ACTIVE

### 4. Test Type Standards

**We define and enforce**:

| Test Type | Location | Purpose | Artifacts |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Unit** | `<crate>/src/` or `<crate>/tests/` | Component isolation | Test reports, coverage data |
| **BDD** | `<crate>/bdd/` | Behavior scenarios | Scenario results, step traces |
| **Integration** | `<crate>/tests/` | Component interaction | Integration logs, state dumps |
| **Property** | `<crate>/tests/` | Invariant verification | Property violations, counterexamples |
| **Smoke** | `<crate>/tests/smoke/` | Real-world validation | End-to-end traces, performance data |

**Standards**:
- All test types MUST produce verifiable artifacts
- All test types MUST fail on skip within Supported Scope
- All test failures MUST be investigated before merging
- All critical paths MUST have comprehensive test coverage

## Our Responsibilities to Other Teams

### Dear orchestratord, pool-managerd, worker-orcd, and all component teams,

We built you the **testing standards** and **quality infrastructure** you need to ship with confidence. Please use them correctly:

**DO**:
- ✅ Review story cards for our test requirements BEFORE coding

- ❌ Mutate product-owned state in tests
- ❌ Add conditional bypasses for failures
- ❌ Ship features without adequate test coverage

**We are here to protect you** — from shipping broken code, from false confidence, from test fraud. But we can only protect you if you follow the standards.

**Remember**: 
- We identify what needs testing BEFORE you code (check your story cards)
- When production fails due to insufficient testing, **we own that failure**

**We Ask**:
- 🔍 Review our test audit findings for security implications
- 🔍 Validate that our test standards don't weaken security
- 🔍 Collaborate on security-critical test patterns

Together, we make llama-orch **tested AND secure**.

### Dear Performance Team (deadline-propagation),

We coordinate on optimization impact:

**Our Promise**:
- ⏱️ We identify performance testing opportunities in story cards

## Our Message to Cheaters

You cannot hide from us. We audit every test. We inspect every test artifact. We validate every skip.

When you:
- Pre-create artifacts to make tests pass
- Add conditional bypasses for failures
- Skip tests within Supported Scope
- Mutate product state in harnesses
- Ship features without adequate test coverage

**We will find you. We will fine you. We will make it public.**

Your test fraud costs the project:
- Broken code in production
- Customer incidents
- Developer time debugging
- Trust in the test suite

**And when production breaks due to insufficient testing, that's OUR failure. We own it. That's why we're ruthless about enforcement.**

**We take this personally. And we prosecute personally.** 🔍

---

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

**Vigilance**:
- Review 100% of story cards for test opportunities (pre-dev)
- Audit 100% of test code changes (post-dev)
- Review 100% of test artifacts
- Validate 100% of skip justifications
- Detect 100% of false positives (goal)
- Prevent 100% of production failures from insufficient testing (goal)

**Fairness**:
- Public fine records with technical details
- Clear remediation requirements
- Escalation path for repeat offenders
- Appeals process for disputed fines

**Transparency**:
- All fines are public
- All standards are documented
- All audit criteria are explicit
- All test artifacts are verifiable
- All production failures we own are publicly acknowledged

**Improvement**:
- Learn from every false positive
- Update standards based on incidents
- Share lessons across teams
- Prevent recurrence through automation
