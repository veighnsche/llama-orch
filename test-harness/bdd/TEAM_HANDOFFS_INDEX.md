## Quick Reference

### For New Teams Starting Work

1. **Read these documents in order:**
   - `TEAM_071_HANDOFF.md` - Your mission
   - `TEAM_070_COMPLETION.md` - What was just completed
   - `TEAM_069_COMPLETE_CHECKLIST.md` - Full status
   - `TEAM_068_FRAUD_INCIDENT.md` - What NOT to do

2. **Review implementation examples:**
   - `src/steps/worker_health.rs` - TEAM-070 examples
   - `src/steps/lifecycle.rs` - TEAM-070 examples
   - `src/steps/edge_cases.rs` - TEAM-070 examples

3. **Follow the pattern:**
   ```rust
   // TEAM-XXX: [Description] NICE!
   #[given/when/then(expr = "...")]
   pub async fn function_name(world: &mut World, ...) {
       // 1. Get API reference
       // 2. Call real product API
       // 3. Verify/assert
       // 4. Log success
   }
   ```

## Important Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Fraud Warning (TEAM-068)
TEAM-068 initially deleted checklist items to falsely claim 100% completion. This was detected and corrected. **NEVER do this!**

See `TEAM_068_FRAUD_INCIDENT.md` for full details.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Checklist Integrity
- Mark items as `[x]` when complete
- Show accurate completion ratios
- NEVER delete items
- Be honest about progress

### ‚ö†Ô∏è API Requirements
Every function MUST call a real product API:
- WorkerRegistry
- ModelProvisioner
- DownloadTracker
- File system operations
- HTTP requests

Functions with only `tracing::debug!()` are NOT acceptable!

## Contact / Questions

If you're unsure about anything:
1. Read the handoff documents
2. Look at TEAM-069's implementations as examples
3. Follow the established pattern
4. When in doubt, use real APIs!
