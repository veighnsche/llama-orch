# TEAM-077 PROGRESS REPORT
# Created by: TEAM-077
# Date: 2025-10-11
# Status: IN PROGRESS

## Mission
Split test-001.feature (1675 lines, 91 scenarios) into 9 focused feature files following BDD best practices.

## Work Completed

### Phase 1: Investigation & Inventory ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Read and analyzed test-001.feature
- [x] Counted scenarios: 91 total
- [x] Created FEATURE_REFACTORING_INVENTORY.md
- [x] Categorized all scenarios by feature area
- [x] Verified no duplicates or gaps

**Deliverable:** `FEATURE_REFACTORING_INVENTORY.md`

### Phase 2: Feature File Design ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Designed 9 feature files with logical grouping
- [x] Verified scenario count: 10+12+9+10+6+10+8+9+17 = 91 ✅
- [x] Planned file sizes (all < 600 lines)
- [x] Preserved all tags (@setup, @error-handling, @critical, @gguf, @edge-case)
- [x] Created FEATURE_FILE_DESIGN.md

**Deliverable:** `FEATURE_FILE_DESIGN.md`

### Phase 3: Create New Feature Files - IN PROGRESS
- [x] 01-ssh-registry-management.feature (10/10 scenarios) ✅
- [ ] 02-model-provisioning.feature (0/12 scenarios)
- [ ] 03-worker-preflight-checks.feature (0/9 scenarios)
- [ ] 04-worker-lifecycle.feature (0/10 scenarios)
- [ ] 05-inference-execution.feature (0/6 scenarios)
- [ ] 06-error-handling-network.feature (0/10 scenarios)
- [ ] 07-error-handling-resources.feature (0/8 scenarios)
- [ ] 08-daemon-lifecycle.feature (0/9 scenarios)
- [ ] 09-happy-path-flows.feature (0/17 scenarios)

**Progress:** 10/91 scenarios migrated (11%)
**Files created:** 1/9
**Compilation:** ✅ PASS (cargo check successful)

## Files Created

### Documentation
1. `FEATURE_REFACTORING_INVENTORY.md` - Complete scenario inventory
2. `FEATURE_FILE_DESIGN.md` - Design document with 9 feature files planned
3. `FEATURE_MIGRATION_TRACKING.md` - Progress tracking document
4. `TEAM_077_PROGRESS.md` - This file

### Feature Files
1. `tests/features/01-ssh-registry-management.feature` - 10 scenarios ✅

## Verification Status

### Compilation
- [x] File 01 compiles successfully
- [ ] All files compile
- [ ] No step definition errors

### Scenario Count
- [x] All 91 scenarios accounted for in design
- [ ] All 91 scenarios migrated to new files
- [ ] No duplicates across files
- [ ] No gaps in migration

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3 continuation)
1. Create file 02-model-provisioning.feature (12 scenarios)
2. Create file 03-worker-preflight-checks.feature (9 scenarios)
3. Create file 04-worker-lifecycle.feature (10 scenarios)
4. Create file 05-inference-execution.feature (6 scenarios)
5. Create file 06-error-handling-network.feature (10 scenarios)
6. Create file 07-error-handling-resources.feature (8 scenarios)
7. Create file 08-daemon-lifecycle.feature (9 scenarios)
8. Create file 09-happy-path-flows.feature (17 scenarios)
9. Verify compilation after each file

### Phase 4: Verification
1. Count scenarios in all new files
2. Compare with original 91 scenarios
3. Run cargo check
4. Run cargo run --bin bdd-runner (test execution)
5. Verify pass/fail rates similar to baseline

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. Final verification checklist
2. Delete test-001.feature
3. Update README.md
4. Create TEAM_077_COMPLETION.md

## Time Estimate

- Phase 1 & 2: ~2 hours (COMPLETE)
- Phase 3: ~4-5 hours (11% complete)
- Phase 4: ~1-2 hours
- Phase 5: ~30 minutes

**Total remaining:** ~5-7 hours

## Compliance with Engineering Rules

### BDD Rules ✅
- [x] Working methodically through phases
- [x] Verifying at each step
- [x] Documenting everything
- [x] No scenarios lost (all 91 accounted for)

### Code Quality ✅
- [x] Added TEAM-077 signature to all files
- [x] Compilation verified after file creation
- [x] Preserving exact text from original

### Documentation ✅
- [x] Created inventory document
- [x] Created design document
- [x] Created tracking document
- [x] Updating progress regularly

## Critical Success Factors

1. **No scenarios lost** - All 91 must be migrated ✅ Verified in design
2. **Preserve exact text** - Copy scenarios exactly (indentation, tags, comments)
3. **Verify at each step** - Compile after each file
4. **Delete only after verification** - test-001.feature deleted last
5. **Document everything** - All tracking documents created

## Status Summary

**Overall Progress:** 11% complete (10/91 scenarios migrated)
**Phase:** 3 of 5 (Create New Feature Files)
**Blockers:** None
**Next Action:** Continue creating feature files 02-09

**TEAM-077 says:** Working methodically! Phase 1 & 2 COMPLETE! File 01 created and verified! Continuing with remaining 8 files! 🐝
