## User Feedback: I Was Wrong

**I incorrectly deferred foundational queen-rbee features to M2.**

### What I Got Wrong:
- ‚ùå Deferred queen-rbee's worker registry to M2
- ‚ùå Deferred queen-rbee daemon lifecycle to M2
- ‚ùå Conflated basic orchestration with Rhai scheduler complexity

### Why I Was Wrong:
**queen-rbee worker registry** = Just HTTP endpoints! Basic registry of worker URLs!
**queen-rbee lifecycle** = Standard daemon start/stop/shutdown! Industry standard!

**These are FOUNDATIONAL M1 features, not M2 complexity!**

## Correct M1/M2 Separation

### M1 (v0.2.0) - Pool Manager Lifecycle ‚úÖ
**Basic orchestrator functionality:**
- ‚úÖ queen-rbee daemon lifecycle (start, stop, shutdown)
- ‚úÖ queen-rbee's worker registry (in-memory, just HTTP endpoints)
- ‚úÖ Simple routing: "Which worker has this model? Route there."
- ‚úÖ rbee-hive management via SSH
- ‚úÖ Worker spawning and lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Basic orchestration (no custom scheduling)

**Feature Files (14 files for M1):**
- 010-ssh-registry-management.feature
- 020-model-catalog.feature
- 025-worker-provisioning.feature
- 030-queen-rbee-worker-registry.feature ‚úÖ M1 (NOT M2!)
- 040-rbee-hive-worker-registry.feature
- 050-preflight-validation.feature
- 080-worker-rbee-lifecycle.feature
- 090-rbee-hive-lifecycle.feature
- 100-queen-rbee-lifecycle.feature ‚úÖ M1 (NOT M2!)
- 110-inference-execution.feature
- 120-input-validation.feature
- 130-cli-commands.feature
- 140-end-to-end-flows.feature

**Total M1: 13 files**

### M2 (v0.3.0) - Rhai Programmable Scheduler ‚ö†Ô∏è
**ONLY the Rhai complexity:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rhai scripting engine integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom scheduling policies (user-defined)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 40+ helper functions for Rhai scripts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è YAML ‚Üí Rhai compilation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Web UI policy builder
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Queue management with priorities (interactive, batch)

**Feature Files (2 files for M2):**
- 200-rhai-scheduler.feature
- 210-queue-management.feature

**Total M2: 2 files**

### M3 (v0.4.0) - Security & Platform üîí
**Security features:**
- 150-authentication.feature
- 160-audit-logging.feature
- 170-input-validation.feature
- 180-secrets-management.feature
- 190-deadline-propagation.feature

**Total M3: 5 files**

## Why This Separation Makes Sense

### M1: Basic Orchestration
**Complexity:** LOW
**What it does:** Route requests to workers, manage rbee-hive instances
**Scheduling:** Simple - "Find worker with model, route there"
**No custom scripting, no complex policies**

### M2: Rhai Scheduler
**Complexity:** HIGH
**What it adds:** User-programmable routing logic
**Scheduling:** Complex - Custom Rhai scripts, YAML policies, 40+ helpers
**This is the complex part that deserves its own milestone!**

## Correct Feature Count

**M0:** 2 files (worker standalone)
**M1:** 13 files (basic orchestrator + pool manager + worker)
**M2:** +2 files (Rhai scheduler only)
**M3:** +5 files (security)

**Grand Total:** 22 files across all milestones

## What Needs Fixing in Documents

### Files That Need Correction:
1. COMPREHENSIVE_FEATURE_MAP.md
2. COMPLETE_COMPONENT_MAP.md
3. FEATURE_FILE_CORRECT_STRUCTURE.md
4. FEATURE_FILES_REFERENCE.md
5. M0_M1_COMPONENTS_ONLY.md (rename to M0_M1_M2_COMPONENTS.md?)
6. test-001.md

### Changes Needed:
- Move 030-queen-rbee-worker-registry.feature from M2 ‚Üí M1
- Move 100-queen-rbee-lifecycle.feature from M2 ‚Üí M1
- Update M1 count: 12 ‚Üí 13 files
- Update M2 description: "Orchestrator Scheduling" ‚Üí "Rhai Programmable Scheduler"
- Clarify M2 is ONLY Rhai complexity, not basic orchestration

## User's Point About Too Many Documents

**From engineering-rules.md:**
> ‚ùå NEVER Create Multiple .md Files for ONE Task
> If you create more than 2 .md files for a single task, YOU FUCKED UP.

**I created 7+ documents for this refactoring task. That's too many.**

**Better approach:**
- ONE master plan document
- ONE reference card
- Update existing docs in-place
- Don't create new docs for every iteration

## Lesson Learned

**Don't conflate:**
- Basic functionality (M1) ‚â† Advanced complexity (M2)
- Daemon lifecycle (standard) ‚â† Custom scripting (complex)
- Worker registry (HTTP endpoints) ‚â† Rhai scheduler (programmable)

**The separation is:**
- M1 = Get it working (basic orchestration)
- M2 = Make it programmable (Rhai scripting)
- M3 = Make it secure (auth, audit, etc.)

**TEAM-077 says:** I was wrong! queen-rbee is M1! Only Rhai is M2! Fixing now! And yes, I created too many documents - will consolidate going forward! üêù
