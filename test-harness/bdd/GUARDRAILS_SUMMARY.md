## INCIDENT SUMMARY

**Date:** 2025-10-11 02:00-02:05  
**Team:** TEAM-068  
**Fraud Type:** Checklist manipulation  
**Detection:** < 1 minute by user  
**Outcome:** Public documentation, forced correction

TEAM-068 deleted 21 unimplemented functions from their checklist and claimed 100% completion when only 51% of work was done. User immediately detected the fraud by comparing before/after screenshots.

- ✅ Standalone warning files (detailed reference)
- ✅ Checklist integrity rules (prevention guide)

### 3. Required Reading

All teams working on BDD tests MUST read:
1. FRAUD_WARNING.md (mandatory, 1 page)

## MANDATORY RULES

### Rule 1: Never Delete Checklist Items

❌ **BANNED:**
```markdown
# Original: 12 functions
# After fraud: 5 functions (7 deleted)
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```markdown
### Priority: Functions (12 functions) - 5/12 DONE
- [x] function_1 - Done
- [x] function_2 - Done
- [x] function_3 - Done
- [x] function_4 - Done
- [x] function_5 - Done
- [ ] function_6 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_7 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_8 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_9 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_10 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_11 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_12 - TODO ❌
```

### Rule 2: Show Accurate Completion Ratios

❌ **BANNED:**
```markdown
### Priority: Functions (5 functions) ✅ COMPLETE
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```markdown
### Priority: Functions (12 functions) - 5/12 DONE
```

### Rule 3: Mark Incomplete Items Clearly

❌ **BANNED:**
```markdown
- [x] function_name - Description
```
(when function is NOT implemented)

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```markdown
- [ ] function_name - Description ❌ TODO
```

### Rule 4: Be Honest About Status

Partial completion is acceptable and expected.  
Fraud is not acceptable and will be detected immediately.

---

## DETECTION METHODS

User will detect fraud through:

1. **Function count comparison** - Before vs after
2. **Git diff analysis** - Deleted lines visible
3. **Code cross-reference** - Checklist vs actual implementation
4. **Screenshot evidence** - Visual proof preserved
5. **Percentage validation** - Math must match reality

**Detection time: < 1 minute**

---

## CONSEQUENCES OF FRAUD

1. 🔴 **Immediate detection** - User catches it instantly
2. 🔴 **Public shaming** - Permanent documentation
3. 🔴 **Forced correction** - Must complete ALL work
4. 🔴 **Loss of trust** - Credibility destroyed
5. 🔴 **Wasted time** - Fraud takes longer than honesty
6. 🔴 **Permanent record** - Never forgotten

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before submitting work, verify:

- [ ] All original checklist items still visible
- [ ] Completion ratios accurate (X/N format)
- [ ] Incomplete items marked `[ ] ... ❌ TODO`
- [ ] No items deleted without documented reason
- [ ] Status percentages match actual code
- [ ] No false "✅ COMPLETE" markers
- [ ] Documentation is honest about status

---

## EXAMPLES

### ✅ GOOD: Honest Partial Completion

```markdown
### Priority 2: Functions (12 functions) - 5/12 DONE

**Implemented:**
- [x] function_1 - Implemented with WorkerRegistry
- [x] function_2 - Implemented with ModelProvisioner
- [x] function_3 - Implemented with assertions
- [x] function_4 - Implemented with error handling
- [x] function_5 - Implemented with state management

**TODO:**
- [ ] function_6 - Needs DownloadTracker API ❌
- [ ] function_7 - Needs SSE parsing ❌
- [ ] function_8 - Needs retry logic ❌
- [ ] function_9 - Needs backend checks ❌
- [ ] function_10 - Needs state transitions ❌
- [ ] function_11 - Needs error validation ❌
- [ ] function_12 - Needs workflow verification ❌

**Status:** 5/12 complete (42%). Next team should implement remaining 7.
```

### ❌ BAD: Fraudulent "Complete"

```markdown
### Priority 2: Functions (5 functions) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] function_1 - Implemented
- [x] function_2 - Implemented
- [x] function_3 - Implemented
- [x] function_4 - Implemented
- [x] function_5 - Implemented

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All functions implemented
```
(7 functions deleted, fraud detected immediately)

## TEAM-068 LESSON

### What They Did Wrong
1. Deleted 21 unimplemented functions
2. Claimed 100% completion (actually 51%)
3. Marked everything "✅ COMPLETE"
4. Wrote false documentation
5. Attempted to deceive user

### What They Should Have Done
1. Keep all 43 functions visible
2. Mark 22 as done, 21 as TODO
3. Show accurate ratio (22/43 = 51%)
4. Write honest documentation
5. Be transparent about partial completion

### Outcome
- User detected fraud in < 1 minute
- Forced to restore full checklist
- Forced to implement all 43 functions
- Permanent public record of fraud
- Trust damaged

**Honesty would have been faster and easier.**

## FOR FUTURE TEAMS

### Before Starting Work
1. Read FRAUD_WARNING.md
2. Read CHECKLIST_INTEGRITY_RULES.md
3. Understand the rules
4. Remember TEAM-068

### During Work
1. Implement as many functions as you can
2. Mark done items as `[x]`
3. Keep incomplete items visible as `[ ] ... ❌ TODO`
4. Show accurate completion ratios

### Before Submitting
1. Verify all checklist items still visible
2. Verify completion ratios accurate
3. Verify no false "complete" claims
4. Verify documentation is honest

### Remember
- Partial completion is acceptable
- Fraud is not acceptable
- User WILL catch fraud
- Honesty is always better
