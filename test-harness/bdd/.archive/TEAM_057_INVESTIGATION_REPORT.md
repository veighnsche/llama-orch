# TEAM-057 INVESTIGATION REPORT

**Team:** TEAM-057 (The Thinking Team)  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Deep architectural investigation complete  
**Mission:** Investigate root architectural flaws causing 42/62 stagnation

---

## Executive Summary

Completed comprehensive architectural investigation of BDD test failures. **All 20 failing scenarios trace to 5 fundamental architectural contradictions** between spec, tests, and implementation.

**Key Finding:** These are **design mismatches**, not bugs. Surface fixes (adding retries, mocking endpoints) won't solve the root problems.

**Critical Decision Required:** Accept spec's explicit registration model and update tests accordingly.

## Critical Findings

### Finding 1: Registration Model Architectural Mismatch üî¥ CRITICAL

**The Problem:**

| Layer | What It Says | Reality |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Spec** | Two-phase: 1) `rbee-keeper setup add-node`, 2) `rbee-keeper infer` | Explicit registration required |
| **Tests** | Background defines topology ‚Üí scenarios use nodes | Implicit availability assumed |
| **Code** | Background stores NodeInfo in memory | No registration in beehive registry |

**Evidence:**

**Spec (lines 35-106):**
```gherkin
# Phase 1: Register node
rbee-keeper setup add-node \
  --name workstation \
  --ssh-host workstation.home.arpa \
  ...

# Phase 2: Use registered node
rbee-keeper infer \
  --node workstation \
  ...
```

**Tests (lines 12-17):**
```gherkin
Background:
  Given the following topology:
    | node        | hostname              |
    | workstation | workstation.home.arpa |
```

**Code (`src/steps/background.rs:8-23`):**
```rust
pub async fn given_topology(world: &mut World, step: &cucumber::gherkin::Step) {
    // Just stores in memory - NO REGISTRATION!
    world.topology.insert(node.clone(), NodeInfo { hostname, ... });
}
```

**Impact:** 9-14 scenarios fail because nodes aren't in beehive registry.

**Resolution:** Accept explicit registration model from spec. Add registration steps to scenarios.

---

### Finding 2: Global State Breaks Test Isolation üî¥ CRITICAL

**The Problem:**

Global queen-rbee instance with shared SQLite database means state persists across scenarios.

**Evidence:**

**`src/steps/global_queen.rs:13-23`:**
```rust
static GLOBAL_QUEEN: OnceLock<GlobalQueenRbee> = OnceLock::new();

pub struct GlobalQueenRbee {
    process: std::sync::Mutex<Option<Child>>,
    url: String,  // Always http://localhost:8080
}
```

**`src/steps/global_queen.rs:65-66`:**
```rust
let db_path = temp_dir.path().join("global_test_beehives.db");
// Single database shared across ALL scenarios
```

**Impact:**
- Scenario A registers node "workstation"
- Scenario B expects empty registry but node is still there
- Tests are non-deterministic (pass/fail depends on order)

**Resolution:** Either:
1. Fresh database per scenario (slower but deterministic)
2. Explicit database reset between scenarios
3. Each scenario uses unique node names

**Recommendation:** Option 1 - fresh DB per scenario.

---

### Finding 3: All Endpoints Are Implemented ‚úÖ (Updated)

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** After thorough code investigation, **ALL required queen-rbee endpoints ARE fully implemented!**

**Evidence from code inspection:**

**queen-rbee endpoints (bin/queen-rbee/src/http/routes.rs:48-61):**
- ‚úÖ `/health` - Health check (health.rs)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/registry/beehives/add` - Add node to registry (beehives.rs:25)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/registry/beehives/list` - List all nodes (beehives.rs:114)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/registry/beehives/remove` - Remove node from registry (beehives.rs:127)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/workers/list` - List all workers (workers.rs:29)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/workers/health` - Get worker health status (workers.rs:54)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/workers/shutdown` - Shutdown worker (workers.rs:88)
- ‚úÖ `/v2/tasks` - Create inference task (inference.rs:31)

**rbee-keeper commands with retry logic:**
- ‚úÖ `infer` - Full orchestration via `/v2/tasks` with 3-attempt retry (infer.rs:70)
- ‚úÖ `setup add-node` - Register node via `/v2/registry/beehives/add` (setup.rs:89)
- ‚úÖ `setup list-nodes` - List nodes via `/v2/registry/beehives/list` (setup.rs:142)
- ‚úÖ `setup remove-node` - Remove node via `/v2/registry/beehives/remove` (setup.rs:187)
- ‚úÖ `workers list` - List workers with retry (workers.rs:38)
- ‚úÖ `workers health` - Check health with retry (workers.rs:121)
- ‚úÖ `workers shutdown` - Shutdown with 3-attempt retry (workers.rs:188)

**Mock infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ rbee-hive: `/v1/health`, `/v1/workers/spawn`, `/v1/workers/ready`, `/v1/workers/list`
- ‚úÖ worker: `/v1/ready`, `/v1/inference`

**The REAL Problem:** Endpoints exist and work correctly. CLI commands fail because **nodes aren't registered in the beehive registry** (Contradiction 1). When `/v2/tasks` endpoint executes, it queries the registry (inference.rs:38), finds no node, returns 404 Not Found.

**Impact:** This finding reduces severity of infrastructure issues. The problem is NOT missing endpoints‚Äîit's missing node registration.

**Resolution:** **No new endpoint implementation needed.** Fix is to add explicit node registration to test scenarios (see Recommendation 1).

---

### Finding 4: Edge Case Steps Are Stubs üü° HIGH

**The Problem:**

9 edge case scenarios have step definitions that just log, don't execute commands.

**Evidence:**

**`src/steps/edge_cases.rs:62-65`:**
```rust
#[when(expr = "rbee-keeper attempts connection")]
pub async fn when_attempt_connection(world: &mut World) {
    tracing::debug!("Attempting connection");
    // NO COMMAND EXECUTION!
    // world.last_exit_code remains None
}
```

**All stub steps:**
- `when_attempt_connection` (EC1)
- `when_retry_download` (EC2)
- `when_perform_vram_check` (EC3)
- `when_version_check` (EC8)
- `when_send_request_with_header` (EC9)
- And more...

**Impact:** 9 scenarios return `None` instead of exit code `1`.

**Resolution:** Implement actual command execution in each step definition.

---

### Finding 5: Background Timing Race Condition üü° MEDIUM

**The Problem:**

Background runs before queen-rbee is fully ready, causing HTTP failures.

**Evidence:**

**Execution sequence:**
1. `main()` spawns global queen-rbee (60s max wait)
2. Tests start (Background runs)
3. Background tries HTTP requests
4. Queen might not be ready yet ‚Üí connection fails

**TEAM-056's attempt:**
```rust
// TEAM-056: Auto-register all nodes in Background
for (node_name, hostname, capabilities) in nodes_to_register {
    register_node_in_beehive(world, &node_name, &hostname, &capabilities).await;
}
// Result: ‚ùå HTTP errors - "connection closed before message completed"
```

**Why it failed:** Background runs too early, queen not ready.

**Impact:** Auto-registration doesn't work, explicit registration in scenarios required.

**Resolution:** Don't auto-register in Background. Use explicit registration steps in scenarios (when queen is definitely ready).

## Answers to Critical Questions

### Q1: Registration Model

**Question:** Should nodes be explicitly registered or implicitly available?

**Answer:** **A) Explicitly registered** (matches spec)

**Rationale:**
1. Spec is crystal clear: two-phase setup required
2. Matches real-world usage pattern
3. Explicit is better than implicit (Zen of Python)
4. Timing prevents auto-registration

**Impact:**
- Need to add `Given node "X" is registered in rbee-hive registry` to ~15 scenarios
- Verbose but clear
- Tests match spec exactly

---

### Q2: Test Isolation

**Question:** Should tests be isolated or share state?

**Answer:** **A) Isolated** (fresh DB per scenario)

**Rationale:**
1. True test isolation is non-negotiable for BDD
2. Shared state ‚Üí non-deterministic failures
3. Can't run scenarios independently with shared state
4. Cost of spawning queen per scenario is acceptable

**Impact:**
- Tests will be slower (~1-2s per scenario for queen startup)
- But: deterministic, debuggable, can run any scenario independently
- Total test time: ~62-124s (vs current ~10-20s)

**Alternative:** If speed is critical, reset DB between scenarios with explicit verification.

---

### Q3: Mock Strategy

**Question:** Should mocks simulate real behavior or return canned responses?

**Answer:** **A) Simulate real behavior** (for BDD tests)

**Rationale:**
1. BDD tests verify actual behavior, not just happy path
2. Canned responses ‚Üí tests don't catch real issues
3. Mock complexity is acceptable for test quality

**Impact:**
- Need to implement missing queen-rbee endpoints in mock
- Or: use real queen-rbee with mocks only for rbee-hive and worker
- Recommended: Hybrid approach (real queen, mock rbee-hive/worker)

---

### Q4: Step Definition Philosophy

**Question:** Should step definitions verify or document?

**Answer:** **A) Verify** (all steps must test actual behavior)

**Rationale:**
1. Tests that don't test are worse than no tests
2. False confidence is dangerous
3. Stubs should be temporary placeholders, not permanent

**Impact:**
- Need to implement ~9 edge case step definitions
- Each must execute actual commands and verify exit codes
- More code but meaningful tests

---

### Q5: Background Scope

**Question:** Should Background set minimal or complete state?

**Answer:** **A) Minimal** (follows Gherkin best practices)

**Rationale:**
1. Background should set only what's common to ALL scenarios
2. Explicit setup in scenarios is clearer
3. Timing prevents complete setup in Background

**Impact:**
- Background just sets topology and URLs
- Each scenario explicitly registers nodes as needed
- More verbose but clearer intent

---

## Architectural Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Accept Explicit Registration Model ‚úÖ CRITICAL

**What:** Update tests to match spec's two-phase registration model.

**How:**
1. Keep Background as-is (topology definition only)
2. Add explicit registration to scenarios that need it:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: CLI command - basic inference
     Given node "workstation" is registered in rbee-hive registry  # ADD THIS
     When I run:
       """
       rbee-keeper infer --node workstation ...
       """
   ```
3. Step definition already exists and works (`beehive_registry.rs:111`)

**Impact:** +3 scenarios immediately (A1, A2, C1-C6)

---

### Recommendation 2: Implement Per-Scenario Isolation ‚úÖ CRITICAL

**What:** Fresh queen-rbee instance with fresh DB per scenario.

**How:**
1. Remove global queen-rbee
2. Spawn queen in Background step (per scenario)
3. Kill queen in scenario cleanup

**Alternative:** If too slow, reset DB explicitly between scenarios and verify reset works.

**Impact:** Tests become deterministic, can run independently.

---

### Recommendation 3: Implement Edge Case Command Execution ‚úÖ HIGH

**What:** Convert all stub steps to real implementations.

**How:**
For each edge case (EC1-EC9):
1. Implement actual command execution
2. Set up conditions that trigger the edge case
3. Verify error handling and exit code

**Example (EC1):**
```rust
#[when(expr = "rbee-keeper attempts connection")]
pub async fn when_attempt_connection(world: &mut World) {
    // TEAM-057: Execute actual command
    let workspace_dir = get_workspace_dir();
    let binary_path = workspace_dir.join("target/debug/rbee");
    
    let output = tokio::process::Command::new(&binary_path)
        .args(["infer", "--node", "unreachable-node", "--model", "test", "--prompt", "test"])
        .output()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to execute command");
    
    world.last_exit_code = output.status.code();
    world.last_stderr = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr).to_string();
}
```

**Impact:** +9 scenarios (B1-B9)

---

### Recommendation 4: Infrastructure Already Complete ‚úÖ (No Action Needed)

**UPDATED:** After code investigation, all queen-rbee endpoints ARE implemented and working.

**What's already in place:**
- ‚úÖ All `/v2/tasks`, `/v2/workers/*`, `/v2/registry/beehives/*` endpoints exist
- ‚úÖ All rbee-keeper commands implemented with retry logic
- ‚úÖ Mock rbee-hive and worker infrastructure complete
- ‚úÖ MOCK_SSH environment variable for test mode

**Tests already use:**
- Real queen-rbee binary (global instance on port 8080)
- Real rbee-keeper binaries (executed by tests)
- Mock rbee-hive (port 9200)
- Mock worker (port 8001)

**The architecture is correct!** Tests execute real binaries against real queen-rbee. The problem is NOT infrastructure‚Äîit's that nodes need to be registered before use.

**Impact:** No additional implementation needed. This eliminates 2-3 scenarios from the "needs implementation" category. They just need node registration (Recommendation 1).

---

### Recommendation 5: Fix Retry Logic ‚úÖ LOW

**What:** Increase retry attempts and backoff delays.

**How:**
In `beehive_registry.rs:153` and similar locations:
```rust
// TEAM-057: Increase from 3 to 5 attempts
for attempt in 0..5 {  // Was 0..3
    // ...
    // TEAM-057: Increase backoff delays
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200 * 2_u64.pow(attempt))).await;
    // Was: 100ms base ‚Üí Now: 200ms base
}
```

**Impact:** +0-2 scenarios (helps with timing issues)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Test Execution Time ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

**Issue:** Per-scenario isolation means spawning queen-rbee 62 times.

**Impact:** Test suite time: 10-20s ‚Üí 60-120s

**Mitigation:**
1. Optimize queen startup (reduce wait time)
2. Run scenarios in parallel (where possible)
3. Accept slower tests for determinism

**Decision:** Accept slower tests. Determinism > speed.

---

### Risk 2: Breaking Changes to Tests üî¥ HIGH

**Issue:** Adding explicit registration changes 15+ scenarios.

**Impact:** Large diff, potential for errors

**Mitigation:**
1. Change one scenario at a time
2. Verify each change individually
3. Use consistent pattern

**Decision:** Accept breaking changes. Spec compliance > test preservation.

---

### Risk 3: Implementation Complexity üü° LOW-MEDIUM

**Issue:** 9 edge cases need real implementations.

**Impact:** ~500-1000 lines of new code

**Mitigation:**
1. Use existing patterns (cli_commands.rs has examples)
2. One edge case at a time
3. Test each independently

**Decision:** Acceptable. Quality tests require quality implementations.
