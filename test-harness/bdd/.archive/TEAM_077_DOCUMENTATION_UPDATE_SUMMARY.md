## Why M2+ Features Are Documented

**User Request:** "Please do not remove the M2+ features because we need those later"

**Approach:**
- All M2+ features are DOCUMENTED in all files
- Clearly marked as "M2" or "M3" with "Documented but deferred" status
- Kept for future reference and planning
- NOT implemented in M0-M1

**Benefits:**
- Complete picture of system architecture
- Future teams know what's coming
- No work lost, just deferred
- Clear milestone boundaries

## Document Consistency

All documents now consistently:
1. ‚úÖ Tag components with milestones (M0, M1, M2, M3)
2. ‚úÖ Mark M2+ features as "deferred" or "documented but not implemented"
3. ‚úÖ Show 13 M0-M1 files + 9 M2+ files = 22 total
4. ‚úÖ Include updated timestamps
5. ‚úÖ Clarify scope in headers

## Next Steps

1. **Proceed with M0-M1 implementation:**
   - Renumber existing 10 files
   - Create 3 new M1 files (025, 050, 060)
   - Extract scenarios from test-001.feature
   - Verify compilation

2. **Keep M2+ files for future:**
   - Don't delete or remove
   - Reference in planning
   - Implement when reaching M2/M3

## Summary

**All documentation updated to reflect:**
- ‚úÖ M0-M1 scope (13 files)
- ‚úÖ M2+ features (9 files, documented but deferred)
- ‚úÖ Milestone tags on all components
- ‚úÖ Clear status indicators
- ‚úÖ Consistent structure across all documents
- ‚úÖ No features removed, just properly scoped

**Status:** ‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION UPDATE COMPLETE
