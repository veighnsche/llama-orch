## Executive Summary

Multiple teams made the **same mistake** about rbee-hive's port number, but for **different reasons**:

1. **TEAM-043** (and earlier): Used port **8080** for rbee-hive ❌ (before architecture change)
2. **TEAM-047**: Used port **8080** for rbee-hive ❌ (didn't update after architecture change)
3. **TEAM-048**: Used port **8080** for rbee-hive ❌ (copied from TEAM-047)
4. **TEAM-053** (me!): Used port **8090** for rbee-hive ❌ (made up a number without checking spec)

**The correct port has ALWAYS been 9200** according to the normative spec!

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**TEAM-043 and earlier teams** built this architecture where:
- rbee-keeper connected DIRECTLY to rbee-hive
- rbee-hive ran on port 8080
- No queen-rbee orchestrator existed

**Status:** ❌ This was the WRONG architecture (but teams didn't know yet)

### After TEAM-037: New Architecture

```

**TEAM-037/TEAM-038** introduced:
- queen-rbee orchestrator (port 8080)
- rbee-hive moved to port 9200
- rbee-keeper became a testing tool

**Status:** ✅ This is the CORRECT architecture

---

## 📊 Timeline of Mistakes

### Phase 1: Pre-Architecture Change (TEAM-043 and earlier)

**Mistake:** rbee-hive on port 8080  
**Why:** This was the original design (before queen-rbee existed)  
**Status:** ❌ Wrong architecture, but teams didn't know yet

**Evidence:**

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_043_FINAL.md line 38:**
```
1. rbee-keeper connects DIRECTLY to rbee-hive at localhost:8080  ← OLD ARCHITECTURE
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_043_FINAL.md line 62:**
```
- ✅ Starts on port 8080 (configurable)  ← rbee-hive on 8080
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_043_FINAL.md line 140:**
```
- ✅ Connects to rbee-hive at `http://{node}.home.arpa:8080`  ← OLD
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_043_FINAL.md line 195:**
```
1. ✅ `rbee-hive` starts and listens on port 8080  ← OLD
```

### Phase 2: Architecture Changed (TEAM-037/TEAM-038)

**Date:** 2025-10-10 (around 14:00)  
**Teams:** TEAM-037 (Testing), TEAM-038 (Implementation)  
**Change:** Introduced queen-rbee orchestrator

**What they did:**
- Created `LIFECYCLE_CLARIFICATION.md` (normative spec)
- Updated `test-001.md` with correct architecture
- Specified rbee-hive port as **9200**
- Specified queen-rbee port as **8080**

**Evidence:**

**test-001.md line 231:**
```bash
ssh -i /home/vince/.ssh/id_ed25519 vince@workstation.home.arpa \
  "cd /home/vince/rbee && ./target/release/rbee-hive daemon --port 9200"  ← CORRECT!
```

**test-001.md line 243:**
```
narrate("rbee-hive starting on port 9200")  ← CORRECT!
```

### Phase 3: Teams Didn't Update (TEAM-047, TEAM-048)

**Mistake:** Still using port 8080 for rbee-hive  
**Why:** Didn't read the updated spec, copied from old handoffs  
**Status:** ❌ Wrong, should have been 9200

**Evidence:**

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_047.md line 152:**
```rust
let rbee_hive_url = if mock_ssh {
    format!("http://{}:8080", node.ssh_host)  ← WRONG! Should be 9200
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_047.md line 157:**
```rust
&format!("{}/rbee-hive daemon --addr 0.0.0.0:8080 &", node.install_path)  ← WRONG!
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_047.md line 161:**
```rust
wait_for_rbee_hive_ready(&format!("http://{}:8080", node.ssh_host)).await?;  ← WRONG!
```

**TEAM_047_SUMMARY.md line 133:**
```
- For tests, use localhost rbee-hive (http://127.0.0.1:8080)  ← WRONG!
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_048.md line 512:**
```bash
curl http://mac.home.arpa:8080/health  ← WRONG! Should be 9200
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_048.md line 513:**
```bash
curl http://mac.home.arpa:8080/v1/workers/list  ← WRONG! Should be 9200
```

### Phase 4: TEAM-053 Made Up a Number

**Mistake:** Used port 8090 for rbee-hive  
**Why:** Assumed a port without checking the spec  
**Status:** ❌ Wrong, should have been 9200

**Evidence:**

**TEAM_053_SUMMARY.md line 60-63:**
```rust
// TEAM-053: Fixed port conflict - rbee-hive uses 8090, not 8080  ← WRONG!
let rbee_hive_url = if mock_ssh {
    "http://127.0.0.1:8090".to_string()  ← WRONG! Should be 9200
```

**HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_054.md line 72:**
```rust
"http://127.0.0.1:8090".to_string()  ← WRONG! Should be 9200
```

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did Multiple Teams Make the Same Mistake?

#### Root Cause 1: Architecture Changed Mid-Project
- TEAM-037/TEAM-038 introduced queen-rbee orchestrator
- Old handoffs still referenced port 8080
- Teams copied from old handoffs without checking spec

#### Root Cause 2: Handoffs Not Updated
- TEAM-043's handoffs said "port 8080"
- TEAM-047 copied from TEAM-043
- TEAM-048 copied from TEAM-047
- **Mistake propagated through handoff chain**

#### Root Cause 3: Didn't Read Normative Spec
- The correct port (9200) was documented in `test-001.md`
- Teams relied on handoffs instead of spec
- **Handoffs are NOT normative, specs ARE**

#### Root Cause 4: Made Assumptions
- TEAM-053 (me!) assumed "8090 sounds reasonable"
- Didn't check the spec
- **Assumptions without verification = mistakes**

---

## ✅ What's Currently Correct

### Code is Correct ✅
**File:** `bin/queen-rbee/src/http/inference.rs` line 57  
**Current:** `"http://127.0.0.1:9200".to_string()`  
**Status:** ✅ CORRECT (I fixed this!)

**Lines:** 231, 243, 254  
**Port:** 9200  
**Status:** ✅ CORRECT (normative spec)

---

## ❌ What Needs Fixing

### Documentation Needs Fixing

**Files to update:**
1. `TEAM_053_SUMMARY.md` - Replace all `8090` with `9200`
2. `HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_054.md` - Replace all `8090` with `9200`
3. `HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_047.md` - Replace all `8080` with `9200` (for rbee-hive)
4. `TEAM_047_SUMMARY.md` - Replace all `8080` with `9200` (for rbee-hive)
5. `HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_048.md` - Replace all `8080` with `9200` (for rbee-hive)

**Note:** TEAM-043's handoffs are historical and don't need fixing (they document the old architecture)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Always Read the Normative Spec
**Problem:** Teams relied on handoffs instead of specs  
**Solution:** Always check `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001.md` first

### Lesson 2: Handoffs Can Be Wrong
**Problem:** Mistakes propagate through handoff chain  
**Solution:** Verify handoff claims against normative spec

### Lesson 3: Architecture Changes Need Propagation
**Problem:** TEAM-037/TEAM-038 changed architecture, but old handoffs weren't updated  
**Solution:** When architecture changes, update ALL handoffs or mark them as obsolete

### Lesson 4: Don't Make Assumptions
**Problem:** TEAM-053 assumed "8090 sounds reasonable"  
**Solution:** Look up documented values, don't guess

### Lesson 5: Port Allocations Need Documentation
**Problem:** No single source of truth for port numbers  
**Solution:** Create a PORT_ALLOCATION.md document

---

## 📚 Correct Port Allocation (Reference)

**Source:** `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001.md` (normative spec)

| Component | Port | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| queen-rbee | 8080 | Control node (blep) | Orchestrator HTTP API |
| rbee-hive | 9200 | Remote nodes (workstation, mac) | Pool manager HTTP API |
| llm-worker-rbee | 8001+ | Remote nodes | Worker HTTP API (sequential) |

**This is the ONLY correct port allocation!**

---

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### For TEAM-054:
1. ✅ Use port **9200** for mock rbee-hive (not 8090!)
2. ✅ Update TEAM_053_SUMMARY.md (replace 8090 with 9200)
3. ✅ Update HANDOFF_TO_TEAM_054.md (replace 8090 with 9200)
4. ✅ Verify against normative spec before implementing

### For Future Teams:
1. ✅ Always check `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001.md` first
2. ✅ Don't trust handoffs blindly
3. ✅ Cross-reference multiple sources
4. ✅ Add spec references to handoffs

### For the Project:
1. ✅ Create `PORT_ALLOCATION.md` document
2. ✅ Add CI check to verify documentation matches spec
3. ✅ Mark old handoffs as "OBSOLETE - Architecture Changed"
4. ✅ Add "Normative Spec Reference" section to all handoffs

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Port Numbers

### Method 1: Check Normative Spec (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST!)
```bash
grep -n "port.*9200" /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001.md
```

**Output:**
```
231:ssh -i /home/vince/.ssh/id_ed25519 vince@workstation.home.arpa "cd /home/vince/rbee && ./target/release/rbee-hive daemon --port 9200"
243:narrate("rbee-hive starting on port 9200")
254:  → USER SEES: [http-server] 🚀 HTTP server ready on port 9200
```

### Method 2: Check Architecture Docs
```bash
grep -n "9200" /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/.specs/LIFECYCLE_CLARIFICATION.md
```

### Method 3: Check Code
```bash
grep -n "9200" /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/queen-rbee/src/http/inference.rs
```

**If any of these don't match, the documentation is WRONG!**

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Impact on Tests
- ✅ Code is correct (9200)
- ❌ Some documentation is wrong (8080, 8090)
- 🟡 Tests might fail if mock server uses wrong port

### Impact on Future Teams
- 🔴 HIGH RISK: Teams might copy wrong port from handoffs
- 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Wasted time debugging port issues
- 🟢 LOW RISK: Code is correct, so tests will eventually work

### Impact on Project
- 🟡 MEDIUM: Confusing documentation
- 🟢 LOW: Easy to fix (find and replace)
- 🟢 LOW: No production impact (tests only)

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Total Teams Affected:** 4 (TEAM-043, TEAM-047, TEAM-048, TEAM-053)  
**Total Handoffs with Mistakes:** 6 documents  
**Root Cause:** Architecture change + handoff propagation + assumptions  
**Current Status:** Code is correct, documentation needs fixing  
**Priority:** Medium (confusing but not blocking)

**Key Takeaway:** Always verify architectural assumptions against the normative spec!
