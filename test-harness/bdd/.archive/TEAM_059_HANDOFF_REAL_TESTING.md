# TEAM-059 HANDOFF - REAL TESTING MANDATE

**From:** TEAM-058  
**To:** TEAM-059  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Completed By:** TEAM-059  
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úÖ REAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT - Phases 1-4 Complete

---

## Executive Mandate

**NO MORE SHORTCUTS. NO MORE MOCKS. BUILD THE REAL THING.**

We're at 42/62 scenarios passing. TEAM-058 discovered that registration works, queen-rbee works, all endpoints exist. **But the remaining 20 failures are because we're testing mock behavior instead of real system behavior.**

**Your mission:** Get to 62/62 by implementing REAL integration testing. Not fast mocks. Not shortcuts. **The actual system running end-to-end.**

---

## The Problem We Discovered

TEAM-058 fixed registration and found that queen-rbee is solid. But when we dug deep, we realized:

### What We Have Now (Mock Heaven)

- ‚úÖ Queen-rbee runs with MOCK_SSH=true
- ‚úÖ Registration endpoints work
- ‚úÖ All HTTP endpoints implemented
- ‚ùå **But tests fail because they expect REAL components:**
  - No actual rbee-hive running
  - No actual workers spawned
  - No actual inference execution
  - No actual model loading
  - No actual SSH connections
  - Exit codes are simulated, not real

### What We Need (The Real Deal)

- ‚úÖ Queen-rbee running (we have this)
- ‚úÖ **Real rbee-hive mock server** responding to HTTP requests
- ‚úÖ **Real worker mock processes** that spawn, load models, serve inference
- ‚úÖ **Real SSH connections** (or proper mock SSH server, not env var checks)
- ‚úÖ **Real command execution** in edge cases
- ‚úÖ **Real exit codes** from actual process termination
- ‚úÖ **Real streaming responses** for SSE/inference
- ‚úÖ **Real database state** that persists between steps

---

## Why This Matters

### Momentum for Real Development

**Current state:** We're testing imaginary behavior. Tests pass but don't prove the system works.

**What we need:** Tests that prove the actual system works end-to-end. When a test passes, we KNOW that feature works in production.

**Impact:** Right now we have 42/62 (68%) but it's **68% of mock behavior**. We need 62/62 (100%) of **REAL behavior**.

### No More Technical Debt

Every shortcut we take now = debt we pay later with interest.

- Mock exit codes = Don't know if real commands work
- Mock SSH = Don't know if real deployments work
- Mock workers = Don't know if real inference works
- Mock rbee-hive = Don't know if real pool management works

**Your job:** Pay down this debt NOW. Build it right. Build it once.

---

## What TEAM-058 Accomplished

‚úÖ Fixed registration serialization bug - nodes register successfully  
‚úÖ Implemented all 6 TODO steps in registry.rs  
‚úÖ Increased HTTP retry resilience  
‚úÖ Added proper stdout/stderr visibility  
‚úÖ Implemented 5 edge case steps (but they're stubs)  
‚úÖ Updated World struct with all needed fields  
‚úÖ Confirmed queen-rbee is production-ready  

**Status:** Infrastructure is solid. Now we need REAL components to test against.

---

## Your Roadmap to 62/62

### Phase 1: Build Real rbee-hive Mock Server (Day 1-2)

**Goal:** HTTP server that responds to rbee-hive endpoints

**Required endpoints:**
- `POST /v2/workers/spawn` - Actually spawn a mock worker process
- `GET /v2/workers/list` - Return list of spawned workers
- `POST /v2/workers/shutdown` - Kill actual worker process
- `GET /health` - Return health status

**Implementation:**
1. Create `test-harness/bdd/src/mock_servers/rbee_hive.rs`
2. Use Axum (same as queen-rbee)
3. Spawn actual worker processes (not simulated)
4. Track worker PIDs and state
5. Return real responses

**Success criteria:**
- Mock server starts on random port
- Queen-rbee can call it via SSH/HTTP
- Workers actually spawn as separate processes
- `ps aux | grep worker` shows real processes

### Phase 2: Build Real Worker Mock (Day 2-3)

**Goal:** Actual binary that acts like a worker

**Required behavior:**
- Bind to HTTP port
- Send ready callback to queen-rbee
- Respond to `/v2/inference` with streaming response
- Respond to `/health` with status
- Exit on shutdown signal

**Implementation:**
1. Create `test-harness/bdd/mock-binaries/mock-worker/main.rs`
2. Implement minimal HTTP server
3. Simulate model loading (3-5 second delay)
4. Return streaming inference responses
5. Proper signal handling for shutdown

**Success criteria:**
- Worker binary runs independently
- Sends callback to queen-rbee
- Serves inference requests
- Shows up in `ps aux`
- Dies cleanly on shutdown

### Phase 3: Wire Up Real Flows (Day 3-4)

**Goal:** Connect all real components in BDD tests

**Changes needed:**

**File:** `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/world.rs`
```rust
pub struct World {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // TEAM-059: Real component processes
    pub rbee_hive_process: Option<Child>,
    pub rbee_hive_url: Option<String>,
    pub worker_processes: Vec<Child>,
    pub worker_urls: Vec<String>,
}
```

**File:** `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/beehive_registry.rs`
```rust
// TEAM-059: Start REAL rbee-hive when node is registered
#[given(expr = "node {string} is registered in rbee-hive registry")]
pub async fn given_node_in_registry(world: &mut World, node: String) {
    // 1. Register node in queen-rbee (already works)
    // 2. Start ACTUAL rbee-hive mock server on that node
    // 3. Store process handle in world.rbee_hive_process
    // 4. Wait for health check
}
```

**File:** `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/worker_lifecycle.rs`
```rust
// TEAM-059: Spawn REAL worker process
#[when(expr = "queen-rbee spawns worker for {string}")]
pub async fn when_spawn_worker(world: &mut World, model: String) {
    // 1. Call rbee-hive HTTP endpoint to spawn worker
    // 2. rbee-hive spawns ACTUAL mock-worker binary
    // 3. Worker sends callback to queen-rbee
    // 4. Store worker PID in world.worker_processes
}
```

### Phase 4: Real Edge Cases (Day 4-5)

**Goal:** Execute actual commands that produce real exit codes

**Currently (WRONG):**
```rust
#[when(expr = "attempt connection to unreachable node")]
pub async fn when_attempt_connection(world: &mut World) {
    world.last_exit_code = Some(1);  // FAKE!
}
```

**What we need (RIGHT):**
```rust
#[when(expr = "attempt connection to unreachable node")]
pub async fn when_attempt_connection(world: &mut World) {
    // TEAM-059: Execute REAL SSH command that actually fails
    let result = tokio::process::Command::new("ssh")
        .arg("-o").arg("ConnectTimeout=1")
        .arg("unreachable.invalid")
        .arg("echo test")
        .output()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to execute ssh");
    
    world.last_exit_code = result.status.code();  // REAL exit code!
}
```

**Apply this pattern to:**
- EC1: Connection timeout - real SSH
- EC2: Download failure - real curl/wget
- EC3: VRAM check - real nvidia-smi
- EC6: Queue full - real worker at capacity
- EC7: Model loading timeout - real timeout

### Phase 5: Real Database State (Day 5)

**Goal:** Test actual SQLite persistence

**Changes:**
1. Each scenario gets fresh database file
2. Test registration persists across steps
3. Test removal actually deletes from DB
4. Test queries return real DB results

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Before each scenario
world.temp_db = Some(tempfile::NamedTempFile::new().unwrap());
world.queen_rbee_process = spawn_queen_with_db(world.temp_db.path()).await;

// After scenario - verify DB state
let conn = Connection::open(world.temp_db.path()).unwrap();
let count: i64 = conn.query_row("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM beehives", [], |row| row.get(0)).unwrap();
assert_eq!(count, expected_count);
```

### Phase 6: Real Streaming (Day 5-6)

**Goal:** Test actual SSE streams from workers

**Implementation:**
1. Worker mock returns real SSE stream
2. Test captures stream events
3. Verify chunk-by-chunk delivery
4. Test cancellation mid-stream

---

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done

**ALL of these must be true:**

1. ‚úÖ **62/62 scenarios passing**
2. ‚úÖ **Real processes spawn** (`ps aux` shows them)
3. ‚úÖ **Real HTTP requests** (not simulated responses)
4. ‚úÖ **Real exit codes** (not hardcoded)
5. ‚úÖ **Real database queries** (SQLite state persists)
6. ‚úÖ **Real streaming responses** (SSE chunks arrive)
7. ‚úÖ **Real cleanup** (all processes die after tests)
8. ‚úÖ **No MOCK_* environment variables** (except for deterministic seeds)

### What "Real" Means

**REAL = Actual process execution with real I/O and real exit codes**

- ‚ùå `world.last_exit_code = Some(1)` - FAKE
- ‚úÖ `Command::new(...).output().await.status.code()` - REAL

- ‚ùå `world.workers.push("worker-123")` - FAKE  
- ‚úÖ `tokio::process::Command::new("mock-worker").spawn()` - REAL

- ‚ùå `if env::var("MOCK_SSH").is_ok()` - FAKE
- ‚úÖ Actual SSH connection or proper SSH mock server - REAL

### Performance Target

**Tests should complete in under 2 minutes for 62 scenarios.**

If it takes longer, that's fine. We're building REAL testing infrastructure. Speed comes later through optimization, not through shortcuts.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T: Set exit codes manually

```rust
world.last_exit_code = Some(1);  // NO!
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Execute real commands

```rust
let output = Command::new("ssh").arg("...").output().await.unwrap();
world.last_exit_code = output.status.code();  // YES!
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Push fake data to World

```rust
world.workers.push(Worker { id: "fake", ... });  // NO!
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Spawn real processes and track them

```rust
let child = Command::new("mock-worker").spawn().unwrap();
world.worker_processes.push(child);  // YES!
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Simulate responses

```rust
world.last_http_response = Some("{}".to_string());  // NO!
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Make real HTTP calls

```rust
let resp = client.get(url).send().await.unwrap();
world.last_http_response = Some(resp.text().await.unwrap());  // YES!
```

## Resources You Have

### Working Components ‚úÖ

- `bin/queen-rbee` - Production-ready orchestrator
- `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/global_queen.rs` - Global queen-rbee launcher
- All HTTP endpoint handlers in `bin/queen-rbee/src/http/`
- SQLite beehive registry
- MOCK_SSH smart mocking (but we need real SSH or proper mock)

### What You Need to Build üî®

- `test-harness/bdd/src/mock_servers/rbee_hive.rs` - Real mock server
- `test-harness/bdd/mock-binaries/mock-worker/` - Real mock worker binary
- Real command execution in edge_cases.rs
- Real process lifecycle management
- Real streaming response handling

### Examples to Follow

Look at how TEAM-058 did real HTTP:
- `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/registry.rs:97-113` - Real HTTP GET
- `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/registry.rs:172-197` - Real HTTP POST

Apply this pattern everywhere.

## Timeline

**Total time budget: 5-6 days**

- Day 1-2: Build rbee-hive mock server ‚úÖ Real HTTP server
- Day 2-3: Build worker mock binary ‚úÖ Real process
- Day 3-4: Wire up real flows ‚úÖ Real integration
- Day 4-5: Real edge cases ‚úÖ Real commands
- Day 5: Real database state ‚úÖ Real persistence
- Day 5-6: Real streaming ‚úÖ Real SSE

**This is REAL development time.** Not "make tests pass" time. We're building infrastructure that will serve us for years.

---

## Measurement

### Daily Check-In Questions

1. How many real processes are we spawning? (Target: 3+ per scenario)
2. How many real HTTP calls are we making? (Target: 5+ per scenario)
3. How many scenarios moved from "mock" to "real"? (Target: 3-4 per day)
4. Can we see all components in `ps aux`? (Target: Yes by Day 2)

### Weekly Goal

**By end of week:** 62/62 scenarios passing with REAL components.

If you hit 55/62 with real components, that's better than 62/62 with mocks.

**Quality over shortcuts. Always.**

---

## Support from TEAM-058

We've laid the groundwork:

‚úÖ Registration works - use it  
‚úÖ Queen-rbee stable - trust it  
‚úÖ Retry logic solid - it handles failures  
‚úÖ World struct ready - we added the fields you need  
‚úÖ Stdio visible - you can see what's happening  

**Build on this foundation. Don't tear it down for shortcuts.**

---

## Philosophical Note

### Why Real Testing Matters

**Mocks test what we think should happen.**  
**Real tests prove what actually happens.**

When you ship rbee to customers, they'll run:
- Real SSH connections
- Real worker processes  
- Real GPU inference
- Real database persistence
- Real network failures

**Our tests should match their reality.**

If a test passes with mocks but fails with real components, **the test is lying to us.**

### Momentum Through Quality

**Fast momentum with shortcuts = Technical debt = Slow down later**  
**Steady momentum with quality = Compound gains = Speed up later**

We're building a platform that will serve thousands of users. Every hour we spend on real testing now saves 100 hours debugging production issues later.

**Build it right. Build it once. Ship it with confidence.**
