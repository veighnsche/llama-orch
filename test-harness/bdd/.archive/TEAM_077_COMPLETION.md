## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Methodical approach** - Following 5 phases prevented errors
2. **Inventory first** - Understanding all scenarios before splitting
3. **Design document** - Planning file structure before creating files
4. **Verification at each step** - Catching issues early
5. **Comprehensive documentation** - Easy to track progress

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Large file size** - 1675 lines required careful reading and extraction
2. **Scenario categorization** - Some scenarios could fit multiple categories
3. **Preserving exact text** - Ensuring indentation and formatting matched
4. **Verification** - Ensuring all 91 scenarios accounted for

### Recommendations for Future Teams
1. **Use the 5-phase approach** - It works well for large refactorings
2. **Create inventory first** - Don't start splitting without understanding scope
3. **Verify counts frequently** - Catch gaps early
4. **Compile after each file** - Don't wait until the end
5. **Document everything** - Makes handoff easier
