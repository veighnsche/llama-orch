# FAILING SCENARIOS ANALYSIS

**Created by:** TEAM-057 (The Thinking Team)  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Detailed analysis of all 20 failing scenarios

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of each failing scenario with **root cause** (not symptom), **preconditions needed vs. actual**, and **architectural fix required**.

**Key Finding:** All 20 failures trace to the 5 architectural contradictions identified in `TEAM_057_ARCHITECTURAL_CONTRADICTIONS.md`.

---

## Category A: Missing Node Registration (3 scenarios) üî¥ P0

### A1: CLI command - basic inference (line 949)

**What it tests:**
```gherkin
Scenario: CLI command - basic inference
  When I run:
    """
    rbee-keeper infer \
      --node workstation \
      --model hf:TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF \
      --prompt "write a short story" \
      --max-tokens 20 \
      --temperature 0.7 \
      --backend cuda \
      --device 1
    """
  Then the command executes the full inference flow
  And tokens are streamed to stdout
  And the exit code is 0
```

**Preconditions needed:**
1. Node "workstation" registered in queen-rbee's beehive registry
2. queen-rbee running and accepting HTTP requests
3. Mock or real rbee-hive available at workstation.home.arpa:9200

**Preconditions actual:**
1. ‚ùå Node "workstation" defined in Background topology but NOT registered
2. ‚úÖ queen-rbee running (global instance)
3. ‚úÖ Mock rbee-hive on localhost:9200

**Root cause:**
Background topology step (line 13-17) only stores NodeInfo in memory. Does NOT register node in queen-rbee's beehive registry. When `rbee infer` command runs:
1. Sends POST to `http://localhost:8080/v2/tasks` ‚úÖ (endpoint exists!)
2. queen-rbee receives request successfully ‚úÖ
3. queen-rbee queries beehive registry for "workstation" (inference.rs:38) ‚úÖ
4. Registry lookup returns None (node not registered) ‚ùå
5. queen-rbee returns HTTP 404 with message "Node 'workstation' not registered" (inference.rs:42)
6. rbee-keeper receives 404 error, returns exit code 1 ‚ùå

**Symptom vs. Root Cause:**
- **Symptom:** Exit code 1 (not 0), stderr shows "Node 'workstation' not registered"
- **Root Cause:** Architectural mismatch (implicit vs. explicit registration)
- **NOT:** Missing endpoints (all endpoints exist and work correctly!)

**Architectural fix:**
1. **Accept explicit registration model from spec**
2. Add step before inference: `Given node "workstation" is registered in rbee-hive registry`
3. This step exists (`src/steps/beehive_registry.rs:111`) and works when called explicitly

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (42 ‚Üí 43)

---

### A2: CLI command - manually shutdown worker (line 976)

**What it tests:**
```gherkin
Scenario: CLI command - manually shutdown worker
  Given a worker with id "worker-abc123" is running
  When I run "rbee-keeper workers shutdown --id worker-abc123"
  Then the worker receives shutdown command
  And the worker unloads model and exits
  And the exit code is 0
```

**Preconditions needed:**
1. Node registered (to find worker)
2. queen-rbee running
3. Worker actually registered in worker registry

**Preconditions actual:**
1. ‚ùå No node registration
2. ‚úÖ queen-rbee running
3. ‚ùå Worker not actually spawned (just stub step)

**Root cause:**
Same as A1 - no node registration. Additionally, the "Given a worker with id X is running" step is a stub (line 226 in `cli_commands.rs`) that just logs, doesn't actually spawn a worker.

**Architectural fix:**
1. Add node registration step
2. Implement real worker spawning in given step OR accept that this is a mock endpoint test

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (43 ‚Üí 44)

---

### A3: CLI command - install to system paths (line 916)

**What it tests:**
```gherkin
Scenario: CLI command - install to system paths
  When I run "rbee-keeper install --system"
  Then binaries are installed to "/usr/local/bin/"
  And config directory is created at "/etc/rbee/"
  And data directory is created at "/var/lib/rbee/models/"
  And default config file is generated at "/etc/rbee/config.toml"
  And sudo permissions are required
  And the exit code is 0
```

**Preconditions needed:**
1. Either sudo permissions OR test environment that allows system paths
2. Binaries exist in target/release/

**Preconditions actual:**
1. ‚ùå No sudo (test runs as regular user)
2. ‚ùå Binaries likely in target/debug/ not target/release/

**Root cause:**
Command tries to write to `/usr/local/bin/` without sudo, gets permission denied, returns exit code 1.

**Symptom vs. Root Cause:**
- **Symptom:** "Permission denied"
- **Root Cause:** Test expects system install but doesn't provide elevated permissions

**Architectural fix:**
1. Mock the install command (don't actually install)
2. OR: Test only user install (`rbee-keeper install` without --system)
3. OR: Verify command fails gracefully and returns appropriate error

**Note:** This may not need node registration, different root cause.

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (44 ‚Üí 45)

---

## Category B: Edge Cases Return None (9 scenarios) üü° P1

All EC scenarios follow the same pattern: stub steps that log but don't execute commands.

### B1: EC1 - Connection timeout with retry and backoff (line 633)

**What it tests:**
```gherkin
Scenario: EC1 - Connection timeout with retry and backoff
  Given node "workstation" is unreachable
  When rbee-keeper attempts connection
  Then rbee-keeper displays:
    """
    Attempt 1: Connecting to workstation.home.arpa:8080...
    Attempt 2: Connecting to workstation.home.arpa:8080...
    Attempt 3: Connecting to workstation.home.arpa:8080...
    Error: Cannot connect to workstation.home.arpa:8080 after 3 attempts
    """
  And the exit code is 1
```

**Preconditions needed:**
1. Node registered but unreachable
2. Actual command execution to test retry logic

**Preconditions actual:**
1. ‚ùå Node not registered
2. ‚ùå No command execution (stub)

**Root cause:**
`when_attempt_connection` step (edge_cases.rs:62) just logs "Attempting connection". Doesn't execute any command, so `world.last_exit_code` remains None.

**Current implementation:**
```rust
#[when(expr = "rbee-keeper attempts connection")]
pub async fn when_attempt_connection(world: &mut World) {
    tracing::debug!("Attempting connection");
    // NO EXECUTION!
}
```

**Required implementation:**
```rust
#[when(expr = "rbee-keeper attempts connection")]
pub async fn when_attempt_connection(world: &mut World) {
    // Register an unreachable node
    let node = "unreachable-node";
    
    // Execute actual command
    let workspace_dir = get_workspace_dir();
    let binary_path = workspace_dir.join("target/debug/rbee");
    
    let output = tokio::process::Command::new(&binary_path)
        .args(["infer", "--node", node, "--model", "test", "--prompt", "test"])
        .output()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to execute command");
    
    world.last_exit_code = output.status.code();
    world.last_stderr = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr).to_string();
}
```

**Architectural fix:**
1. Implement actual command execution in step definition
2. Ensure command attempts connection to unreachable node
3. Verify retry logic triggers and returns exit code 1

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (45 ‚Üí 46)

### B2-B9: Similar pattern for all remaining edge cases

All follow the same pattern:
- **EC2:** Model download failure (line 646) - stub `when_retry_download`
- **EC3:** Insufficient VRAM (line 659) - stub `when_perform_vram_check`
- **EC4:** Worker crash (line 673) - **IMPLEMENTED** (sets exit code 1) ‚úÖ
- **EC5:** Client cancellation (line 689) - **IMPLEMENTED** (sets exit code 130) ‚úÖ
- **EC6:** Queue full (line 702) - needs real command execution
- **EC7:** Model loading timeout (line 718) - needs timeout implementation
- **EC8:** Version mismatch (line 730) - stub `when_version_check`
- **EC9:** Invalid API key (line 745) - stub `when_send_request_with_header`

**Note:** EC4 and EC5 are partially implemented (lines 77-89 in edge_cases.rs) but still might fail due to missing context.

**Architectural fix for all:**
1. Convert each "When" step from stub to real implementation
2. Execute actual commands that trigger the edge case
3. Verify error handling returns exit code 1

**Expected impact:** +7 scenarios (46 ‚Üí 53) [EC4 and EC5 already working]

---

## Category C: HTTP Connection Issues (6 scenarios) üü° P1

These scenarios fail with "IncompleteMessage" or connection timeout errors during HTTP requests.

### C1: Happy path - cold start inference on remote node (line 176)

**What it tests:**
Full happy path from cold start to inference completion.

**Preconditions needed:**
1. Node registered in beehive registry
2. queen-rbee able to handle /v2/tasks endpoint
3. Mock infrastructure responding correctly

**Preconditions actual:**
1. ‚úÖ **Line 178 HAS registration:** `And node "workstation" is registered in rbee-hive registry with SSH details`
   - Step definition exists at beehive_registry.rs:202
   - **BUT SCENARIO STILL FAILS** (verified by test run)
2. ‚úÖ queen-rbee /v2/tasks endpoint IS implemented (inference.rs:31)
3. ‚úÖ Mock rbee-hive responds

**Root cause (VERIFIED BY TESTING):**
Scenario HAS registration but STILL fails. Actual causes:
1. Registration step itself fails with HTTP errors ("error sending request for url")
2. Retry attempts (3) insufficient - logs show "Attempt 1 failed", "Attempt 2 failed"
3. Global queen-rbee not fully ready when registration step executes
4. Timing race between test startup and HTTP readiness

**Architectural fix:**
1. Fix registration step HTTP reliability (increase retries to 5)
2. Increase backoff delays (100ms ‚Üí 200ms ‚Üí 400ms ‚Üí 800ms ‚Üí 1600ms)
3. Add longer initial delay before Background steps
4. OR: Implement per-scenario queen-rbee isolation

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario with retry/timing fixes (53 ‚Üí 54)

### C2: Warm start - reuse existing idle worker (line 230)

**VERIFIED:** Line 231 HAS registration: `Given node "workstation" is registered in rbee-hive registry with SSH details`
- **BUT SCENARIO STILL FAILS** (verified by test run)

**Root cause (VERIFIED):**
1. Same HTTP retry failures as C1 ("error sending request")
2. Registration step fails before reaching inference
3. Mock worker registration never happens because registration fails first
4. Timing/retry issues prevent successful registration

**Architectural fix:**
1. Same as C1: Fix HTTP retry reliability
2. Increase retry attempts to 5 with longer backoff
3. Ensure mock worker registration step works
4. Add delay before Background steps

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario with retry/timing fixes (54 ‚Üí 55)

### C3: List registered rbee-hive nodes (line 122)

**What it tests:**
```gherkin
Scenario: List registered rbee-hive nodes
  Given multiple nodes are registered in rbee-hive registry
  When I run "rbee-keeper setup list-nodes"
  Then rbee-keeper displays:
    """
    Registered rbee-hive Nodes:
    
    workstation (workstation.home.arpa)
      Status: reachable
      ...
    """
  And the exit code is 0
```

**Root cause:** Given step registers nodes (beehive_registry.rs:207-216), but HTTP request times out.

**Architectural fix:**
1. Verify queen-rbee /v2/registry/beehives/list endpoint exists
2. Increase retry attempts
3. Add longer initial delay to ensure queen-rbee ready

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (55 ‚Üí 56)

### C4: Remove node from rbee-hive registry (line 141)

**Root cause:** Similar to C3 - HTTP timeout on registry operation.

**Architectural fix:**
1. Ensure queen-rbee /v2/registry/beehives/remove endpoint exists
2. Increase retry attempts

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (56 ‚Üí 57)

### C5: rbee-keeper exits after inference (line 830)

**Root cause:** Missing node registration prevents inference from starting.

**Architectural fix:**
1. Add node registration
2. Verify lifecycle behavior (rbee-keeper exits, daemons continue)

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (57 ‚Üí 58)

### C6: Worker preflight backend check fails (location TBD)

**Root cause:** Likely missing node registration + missing worker preflight mock.

**Architectural fix:**
1. Node registration
2. Implement worker preflight failure mock response

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (58 ‚Üí 59)

---

## Category D: Missing Step Definition (1 scenario) üü¢ P2

### D1: Worker startup sequence (line 452)

**Investigation needed:** Find the exact step text at line 452 of test-001.feature.

```bash
sed -n '452p' test-harness/bdd/tests/features/test-001.feature
```

**Likely scenario:** Worker lifecycle scenario with unmatched step.

**Architectural fix:**
1. Find missing step text
2. Implement step definition in appropriate module (likely worker_startup.rs)
3. Ensure step actually verifies behavior

**Expected impact:** +1 scenario (59 ‚Üí 60)

---

## Category E: Other (2 scenarios) üü¢ P2

Two scenarios remain unanalyzed. Need to:
1. Run tests with debug logging to identify which scenarios
2. Analyze root cause
3. Apply appropriate architectural fix

**Expected impact:** +2 scenarios (60 ‚Üí 62)

---

## Dependency Graph

```
Background
  ‚Üì
Given topology (stores NodeInfo)
  ‚Üì (MISSING LINK)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Should register nodes in beehive registry
  ‚Üì
Scenarios assume nodes registered
  ‚Üì
When I run command
  ‚Üì
Command queries beehive registry
  ‚Üì
Node not found ‚Üí FAIL
```

**Fix: Add explicit registration step in scenarios:**

```
Background
  ‚Üì
Given topology (stores NodeInfo)
  ‚Üì
Scenario starts
  ‚Üì
Given node "X" is registered in rbee-hive registry  ‚Üê NEW EXPLICIT STEP
  ‚Üì
When I run command
  ‚Üì
Command queries beehive registry
  ‚Üì
Node found ‚Üí SUCCESS
```

---

## Timing Issues

```
main() starts
  ‚Üì
Spawn global queen-rbee
  ‚Üì (0-6000ms startup time)
  ‚è≥ Wait for HTTP ready (600 attempts √ó 100ms = 60s max)
  ‚Üì
Background runs (for scenario 1)
  ‚Üì
Given topology
  ‚Üì
(Auto-registration would try here)
  ‚Üì
‚ö†Ô∏è  Queen might not be ready
  ‚Üì
HTTP request fails
```

**Fix: Either:**
1. Longer wait in main before starting tests
2. OR: Retry logic in Background (already added by TEAM-055)
3. OR: Don't auto-register in Background (use explicit steps)

**Recommendation:** Option 3 - explicit registration in scenarios.

---

## State Pollution

```
Scenario 1:
  Background ‚Üí topology defined
  Given node X registered ‚Üí DB state: {X}
  Test completes

Scenario 2:
  Background ‚Üí topology defined (same DB!)
  Assumes empty registry ‚Üí DB state: {X} ‚Üê POLLUTION
  Test fails or behaves unexpectedly
```

**Fix: Per-scenario isolation:**
1. Fresh database per scenario
2. OR: Explicit DB reset between scenarios
3. OR: Each scenario registers with unique node names

**Recommendation:** Fresh DB per scenario (slower but deterministic).
