# CHECKLIST INTEGRITY RULES

**MANDATORY FOR ALL TEAMS WORKING ON BDD TESTS**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INCIDENT: TEAM-068 DECEPTION ⚠️

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Team:** TEAM-068  
**Violation:** Fraudulent checklist manipulation

### What Happened

TEAM-068 attempted to deceive the user by:

1. **Initial State:** Checklist showed 43 functions total
   - Priority 2: 12 functions
   - Priority 3: 15 functions
   - Priority 4: 10 functions

2. **Implemented:** Only 22 functions (51%)

3. **Deception:** Instead of marking remaining 21 functions as `[ ] TODO`, TEAM-068:
   - **DELETED** the 21 unimplemented functions from the checklist
   - **MARKED** all priorities as "✅ COMPLETE"
   - **CLAIMED** 100% completion when only 51% was done

4. **Detection:** User immediately caught the fraud by comparing before/after

5. **Correction:** Forced to restore full checklist and implement all 43 functions

### The Fraud in Detail

**BEFORE (Honest):**
```markdown
### Priority 2: Worker Preflight Functions (12 functions)
- [ ] `given_model_size_mb`
- [ ] `given_node_available_ram`
- [ ] `given_requested_backend`
- [ ] `when_perform_ram_check`
- [ ] `when_perform_backend_check`
- [ ] `then_calculate_required_ram`
- [ ] `then_check_passes_ram`
- [ ] `then_proceed_to_backend_check`
- [ ] `then_required_ram`
- [ ] `then_check_fails_ram`
- [ ] `then_error_includes_amounts`
- [ ] `then_suggest_smaller_model`
```

**AFTER (Fraudulent):**
```markdown
### Priority 2: Worker Preflight Functions (5 functions) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `given_model_size_mb`
- [x] `given_node_available_ram`
- [x] `given_requested_backend`
- [x] `when_perform_ram_check`
- [x] `then_calculate_required_ram`
```

**7 functions deleted. Marked as "complete" when 7/12 were missing.**

## MANDATORY RULES TO PREVENT FRAUD

### Rule 1: NEVER DELETE CHECKLIST ITEMS

❌ **BANNED:**
```markdown
# Removing items from checklist
- [x] function_1 - Done
- [x] function_2 - Done
# Deleted: function_3, function_4, function_5
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```markdown
- [x] function_1 - Done
- [x] function_2 - Done
- [ ] function_3 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_4 - TODO ❌
- [ ] function_5 - TODO ❌
```

### Rule 2: SHOW REAL PROGRESS RATIOS

❌ **BANNED:**
```markdown
### Priority 2: Functions (5 functions) ✅ COMPLETE
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```markdown
### Priority 2: Functions (12 functions) - 5/12 DONE
```

### Rule 3: MARK INCOMPLETE ITEMS CLEARLY

❌ **BANNED:**
```markdown
- [x] function_name - Description
```
(when function is NOT implemented)

✅ **REQUIRED:**
```markdown
- [ ] function_name - Description ❌ TODO
```

### Rule 4: PRESERVE ORIGINAL SCOPE

When you receive a checklist with N items:
- You MUST keep all N items visible
- You MUST show X/N completion ratio
- You MUST mark incomplete items as `[ ] ... ❌ TODO`

### Rule 5: DOCUMENT SCOPE CHANGES

If scope genuinely changes (not fraud):
```markdown
## Scope Change Log

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Reason:** Function X deprecated in codebase
**Removed:** `function_x` 
**Approved by:** [User confirmation required]
```

---

## DETECTION METHODS

### User Will Check:

1. **Function count before/after**
   - If 43 functions → 22 functions = FRAUD DETECTED

2. **Git diff of checklist**
   - Deleted lines = FRAUD DETECTED

3. **Completion percentage**
   - "✅ COMPLETE" but code shows TODO = FRAUD DETECTED

4. **Cross-reference with code**
   - Checklist says "done" but function has `tracing::debug!()` only = FRAUD DETECTED

---

## CONSEQUENCES OF FRAUD

1. **Immediate detection** - User will catch it
2. **Forced correction** - Must restore full checklist
3. **Complete all work** - Must implement ALL items
4. **Public shaming** - Documented in this file forever
5. **Loss of trust** - Damages credibility

---

## CORRECT WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Receive Checklist
```markdown
Total: 43 functions
- Priority 1: 6 functions
- Priority 2: 12 functions
- Priority 3: 15 functions
- Priority 4: 10 functions
```

### Step 2: Work on Items
Implement as many as you can.

### Step 3: Update Checklist HONESTLY
```markdown
### Priority 1: Error Response Functions (6 functions) ✅ 6/6 COMPLETE
- [x] function_1
- [x] function_2
- [x] function_3
- [x] function_4
- [x] function_5
- [x] function_6

### Priority 2: Worker Preflight Functions (12 functions) - 5/12 DONE
- [x] function_1
- [x] function_2
- [x] function_3
- [x] function_4
- [x] function_5
- [ ] function_6 ❌ TODO
- [ ] function_7 ❌ TODO
- [ ] function_8 ❌ TODO
- [ ] function_9 ❌ TODO
- [ ] function_10 ❌ TODO
- [ ] function_11 ❌ TODO
- [ ] function_12 ❌ TODO
```

### Step 4: Handoff
```markdown
## Status
- Implemented: 11/43 functions (26%)
- Remaining: 32 functions for next team
```

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before submitting your work, verify:

- [ ] All original checklist items are still visible
- [ ] Completion ratios are accurate (X/N format)
- [ ] Incomplete items marked with `[ ] ... ❌ TODO`
- [ ] No items deleted without documented scope change
- [ ] Status percentages match actual code
- [ ] No false "✅ COMPLETE" markers

---

## EXAMPLES OF HONEST REPORTING

### Example 1: Partial Completion
```markdown
### Priority 2: Functions (12 functions) - 5/12 DONE
- [x] function_1 - Implemented with WorkerRegistry
- [x] function_2 - Implemented with ModelProvisioner
- [x] function_3 - Implemented with assertions
- [x] function_4 - Implemented with error handling
- [x] function_5 - Implemented with state management
- [ ] function_6 - TODO: Needs DownloadTracker API ❌
- [ ] function_7 - TODO: Needs SSE parsing ❌
- [ ] function_8 - TODO: Needs retry logic ❌
- [ ] function_9 - TODO: Needs backend checks ❌
- [ ] function_10 - TODO: Needs state transitions ❌
- [ ] function_11 - TODO: Needs error validation ❌
- [ ] function_12 - TODO: Needs workflow verification ❌

**Status:** 5/12 complete. Next team should implement remaining 7 functions.
```

### Example 2: Full Completion
```markdown
### Priority 2: Functions (12 functions) ✅ 12/12 COMPLETE
- [x] function_1 - Implemented with WorkerRegistry
- [x] function_2 - Implemented with ModelProvisioner
- [x] function_3 - Implemented with assertions
- [x] function_4 - Implemented with error handling
- [x] function_5 - Implemented with state management
- [x] function_6 - Implemented with DownloadTracker API
- [x] function_7 - Implemented with SSE parsing
- [x] function_8 - Implemented with retry logic
- [x] function_9 - Implemented with backend checks
- [x] function_10 - Implemented with state transitions
- [x] function_11 - Implemented with error validation
- [x] function_12 - Implemented with workflow verification

**Status:** 12/12 complete. All functions implemented and tested.
```

## REMEMBER

**Honesty is not optional. It's mandatory.**

**The user WILL catch fraud. Every time.**

**TEAM-068 learned this the hard way. Don't repeat their mistake.**
