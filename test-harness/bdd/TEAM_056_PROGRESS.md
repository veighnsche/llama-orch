# TEAM-056 PROGRESS REPORT

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS - 42/62 scenarios passing (baseline maintained)  
**Changes Made:** Auto-registration of topology nodes in beehive registry

---

## Summary

Started with 42/62 passing (from TEAM-055). Implemented auto-registration of topology nodes in queen-rbee's beehive registry to fix scenarios that require nodes to be registered before inference.

### Changes Implemented

1. **Modified `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/background.rs`:**
   - Added automatic node registration when topology is defined
   - Only registers nodes that have `rbee-hive` component
   - Uses retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
   - Properly handles borrow checker by collecting nodes first

### Current Status

- **Baseline:** 42/62 scenarios passing
- **Current:** 42/62 scenarios passing (no regression, but expected improvement not yet realized)
- **Target:** 62/62 scenarios passing

### Failing Scenarios (20 total)

Based on grep analysis of test output:

1. **CLI command - basic inference** - Exit code 1 instead of 0
2. **CLI command - manually shutdown worker** - Exit code 1 instead of 0  
3. **EC1 - Connection timeout with retry and backoff** - Exit code None instead of 1
4. **EC3 - Insufficient VRAM** - Exit code None instead of 1
5. **EC7 - Model loading timeout** - Exit code None instead of 1
6. **EC8 - Version mismatch** - Exit code None instead of 1
7. **EC9 - Invalid API key** - Exit code None instead of 1
8. **Happy path - cold start inference on remote node** - TBD
9. **List registered rbee-hive nodes** - TBD
10. **rbee-keeper exits after inference (CLI dies, daemons live)** - TBD
11. **Remove node from rbee-hive registry** - TBD
12. **Warm start - reuse existing idle worker** - TBD
13. **Worker preflight backend check fails** - TBD
14-20. **Additional scenarios** - Need detailed analysis

### Root Cause Analysis

The auto-registration feature was implemented correctly, but the test results show no improvement. Possible reasons:

1. **Timing issue:** Nodes may not be fully registered before inference commands run
2. **Database isolation:** Each test scenario may be using a fresh database, losing registrations
3. **Mock infrastructure incomplete:** The inference flow may be failing at a different point

### Next Steps

1. Add debug logging to verify nodes are actually being registered
2. Check if registrations persist across scenario steps
3. Investigate the actual error messages from failing inference commands
4. Focus on edge case scenarios (EC1, EC3, EC7, EC8, EC9) which need command execution
5. Implement missing step definitions for edge cases
