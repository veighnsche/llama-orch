## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: READ BEFORE WORKING ON BDD TESTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üî¥ FRAUD WARNING üî¥**

TEAM-068 attempted checklist fraud on 2025-10-11. They deleted 21 unimplemented functions from their checklist and claimed 100% completion when only 51% was done. User caught the fraud in < 1 minute.

**REQUIRED READING:**
1. **FRAUD_WARNING.md** - Critical incident summary
2. **CHECKLIST_INTEGRITY_RULES.md** - Prevention guidelines
3. **TEAM_068_FRAUD_INCIDENT.md** - Full incident report

**RULES:**
- ‚ùå NEVER delete checklist items
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS mark incomplete items as `[ ] ... ‚ùå TODO`
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS show accurate completion ratios (X/N format)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS be honest about status

**Checklist fraud = immediate detection + public shaming + forced correction**

## Overview

This directory contains Gherkin feature files that describe the behavior of the llama-orch distributed inference system. These tests validate the complete system behavior from a user's perspective.

**200-210:** Concurrency and failure recovery
**900:** End-to-end integration

## Critical Lifecycle Rules

### RULE 1: rbee-hive is a PERSISTENT HTTP DAEMON
- **Starts:** `rbee-hive daemon` or spawned by rbee-keeper
- **Runs:** Continuously as HTTP server on port 8080
- **Dies:** ONLY when receiving SIGTERM (Ctrl+C) or explicit shutdown
- **Does NOT die:** After spawning workers, after inference completes

### RULE 2: llm-worker-rbee is a PERSISTENT HTTP DAEMON
- **Starts:** Spawned by rbee-hive
- **Runs:** Continuously as HTTP server on port 8001+
- **Dies:** When idle timeout (5 min) OR rbee-hive sends shutdown OR SIGTERM
- **Does NOT die:** After inference completes (stays idle)

### RULE 3: rbee-keeper is a CLI (EPHEMERAL)
- **Starts:** User runs command
- **Runs:** Only during command execution
- **Dies:** After command completes (exit code 0 or 1)
- **Does NOT die:** Never stays running

### RULE 4: Ephemeral Mode (rbee-keeper spawns rbee-hive)
```
rbee-keeper spawns rbee-hive as child process
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive spawns worker
    ‚Üì
Inference completes
    ‚Üì
rbee-keeper sends SIGTERM to rbee-hive
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive cascades shutdown to worker
    ‚Üì
All processes exit
```

### RULE 5: Persistent Mode (rbee-hive pre-started)
```
Operator starts: `rbee-hive daemon &`
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive runs continuously
    ‚Üì
rbee-keeper connects to existing rbee-hive
    ‚Üì
Inference completes
    ‚Üì
rbee-keeper exits
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive continues running
    ‚Üì
Worker continues running (until idle timeout)
```

### RULE 6: Cascading Shutdown
```
SIGTERM ‚Üí rbee-hive
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive ‚Üí POST /v1/admin/shutdown ‚Üí all workers
    ‚Üì
Workers unload models and exit
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive clears registry and exits
    ‚Üì
Model catalog (SQLite) persists on disk
```

### RULE 7: Worker Idle Timeout
```
Worker completes inference ‚Üí idle
    ‚Üì
5 minutes elapse without new requests
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive sends shutdown to worker
    ‚Üì
Worker exits, VRAM freed
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive continues running
```

### RULE 8: Process Ownership
- **IF** rbee-keeper spawned rbee-hive ‚Üí rbee-keeper owns lifecycle
- **IF** operator started rbee-hive ‚Üí operator owns lifecycle
- rbee-hive always owns worker lifecycle
- Workers never own their own lifecycle (managed by rbee-hive)

## Running Tests

### üöÄ Rust xtask Runner (TEAM-111)

**Professional-grade Rust test runner integrated with xtask:**
- ‚úÖ Live output by default (see everything in real-time!)
- ‚úÖ Failure-focused reporting (only failures shown at end)
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated rerun commands (instant retry of failed tests)
- ‚úÖ Type-safe Rust implementation
- ‚úÖ Integrated with workspace tooling

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Run all tests with live output
cargo xtask bdd:test

# Run specific tests
cargo xtask bdd:test --tags @auth
cargo xtask bdd:test --feature lifecycle

# Quiet mode (for CI/CD)
cargo xtask bdd:test --quiet

# Help
cargo xtask bdd:test --help
```

**Features:**
- Live output streaming (default)
- Quiet mode with progress spinner
- Tag filtering (`--tags @auth`)
- Feature filtering (`--feature lifecycle`)
- Compilation check before tests
- Test discovery and counting
- Failure extraction (multiple patterns)
- Timestamped log files
- Summary generation
- Rerun command generation

### Legacy: Direct BDD Runner

You can still run the BDD runner directly:

```bash
# From repository root
LLORCH_BDD_FEATURE_PATH=test-harness/bdd/tests/features \
  cargo run --bin bdd-runner
```

### Run MVP Scenarios Only
```bash
# Run scenarios tagged with @mvp
LLORCH_BDD_FEATURE_PATH=test-harness/bdd/tests/features/test-001-mvp.feature \
  cargo run --bin bdd-runner
```

### Run Specific Scenario
```bash
# Run by line number
LLORCH_BDD_FEATURE_PATH=test-harness/bdd/tests/features/test-001-mvp.feature:25 \
  cargo run --bin bdd-runner
```

### Run Lifecycle Tests Only
```bash
# Run scenarios tagged with @lifecycle
LLORCH_BDD_FEATURE_PATH=test-harness/bdd/tests/features \
  cargo run --bin bdd-runner -- --tags @lifecycle
```

## Architecture Context

### Components Under Test

| Component | Type | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|-----------|------|---------|-----------|
| **rbee-keeper** | CLI | Remote control, calls HTTP APIs | Ephemeral (dies after command) |
| **rbee-hive** | HTTP Daemon | Pool management, worker spawning | Persistent (dies on SIGTERM) |
| **llm-worker-rbee** | HTTP Daemon | Inference execution, model in VRAM | Persistent (dies on timeout/shutdown) |
| **queen-rbee** | HTTP Daemon | Orchestration, routing (M1+) | Persistent (future) |

### Storage Strategy (TEAM-030)

**Worker Registry:** In-memory HashMap (ephemeral)
- Location: rbee-hive process memory
- Lifecycle: Lost on rbee-hive restart
- Rationale: Workers are transient, no persistence needed

**Model Catalog:** SQLite database (persistent)
- Location: `~/.rbee/models.db`
- Lifecycle: Survives rbee-hive restarts
- Rationale: Models are large files, track downloads to prevent re-downloading

## Test Patterns

### Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given <precondition>
When <action>
Then <expected outcome>
And <additional assertion>
```

### Data Tables
```gherkin
Given a worker is registered with:
  | field      | value           |
  | id         | worker-abc123   |
  | state      | idle            |
```

### Multi-line Strings
```gherkin
When I run:
  """
  rbee-keeper infer \
    --node mac \
    --prompt "hello"
  """
```

### Tags for Filtering
- `@mvp` - MVP scenarios
- `@critical` - Critical path
- `@edge-case` - Edge case handling
- `@lifecycle` - Process lifecycle
- `@happy-path` - Happy path flows

## BDD Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO
- Write scenarios from user's perspective
- Use Given-When-Then structure
- Make scenarios independent
- Use tags for organization
- Document lifecycle expectations
- Reference spec IDs in traceability headers

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Test implementation details
- Create dependencies between scenarios
- Assume execution order
- Mix multiple concerns in one scenario
- Skip lifecycle clarifications

## Contributing

When adding new scenarios:

1. **Read the spec first** - Understand the behavior being tested
2. **Check existing scenarios** - Avoid duplication
3. **Use appropriate tags** - `@mvp`, `@critical`, `@edge-case`, `@lifecycle`
4. **Document lifecycle** - Clarify when processes start/stop
5. **Add traceability** - Reference spec IDs in comments
6. **Follow patterns** - Use Given-When-Then, data tables, multi-line strings
7. **Test independently** - Each scenario should be self-contained
8. **Sign your work** - Add team signature per dev-bee-rules.md

## Status

- ‚úÖ **test-001.feature** - Complete (67 scenarios)
- ‚úÖ **test-001-mvp.feature** - Complete (27 scenarios)
- ‚úÖ **Lifecycle rules** - Documented and tested
- ‚è≥ **Step definitions** - To be implemented
