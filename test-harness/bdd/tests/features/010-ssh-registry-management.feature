Feature: SSH Registry Management
  As a user setting up distributed inference
  I want to register remote nodes with SSH details
  So that queen-rbee can manage remote rbee-hive instances

  Background:
    Given the following topology:
      | node        | hostname              | components                                      | capabilities           |
      | blep        | blep.home.arpa        | rbee-keeper, queen-rbee                         | cpu                    |
      | workstation | workstation.home.arpa | rbee-hive, llm-worker-rbee                      | cuda:0, cuda:1, cpu    |
    # NOTE: This test suite uses workstation node with cuda backend on device 1
    And I am on node "blep"
    And queen-rbee is running at "http://localhost:8080"
    And the model catalog is SQLite at "~/.rbee/models.db"
    And the worker registry is in-memory ephemeral per node
    And the rbee-hive registry is SQLite at "~/.rbee/beehives.db"

  # ============================================================================
  # PREREQUISITES: rbee-hive Registry Setup (TEAM-041)
  # ============================================================================
  # CRITICAL: Before any inference can happen, remote rbee-hive nodes must be
  # configured through rbee-keeper. The queen-rbee maintains a persistent
  # rbee-hive Registry with SSH connection details.
