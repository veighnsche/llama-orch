# AUTOGENERATED: Proof Bundle

# Implementation Summary — Proof Bundle Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Implemented by**: proof-bundle team  
**Requested by**: vram-residency team  

---

## ✅ COMPLETED

The proof bundle system now **automatically cleans up old bundles** before creating new ones.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Core Implementation
**File**: `test-harness/proof-bundle/src/fs/bundle_root.rs`

Added cleanup logic to `ProofBundle::for_type()`:
- Scans test type directory for existing bundles
- Removes all old bundle directories
- Creates new bundle with current run ID
- **Result**: Only 1 bundle per test type at any time

### 2. Test Coverage
**File**: `test-harness/proof-bundle/src/lib.rs`

Added test `cleanup_removes_old_bundles`:
- ✅ Verifies old bundles are deleted
- ✅ Verifies only latest bundle remains
- ✅ All tests passing

### 3. Documentation
**Updated files**:
- `/.proof_bundle/README.md` — Status changed to "✅ IMPLEMENTED"
- `/test-harness/proof-bundle/README.md` — Added "Cleanup Policy" section
- `/.proof_bundle/CLEANUP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Full implementation details for auditors

---

## Verification

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test -p proof-bundle

# All 12 tests pass:
# - 3 unit tests (including new cleanup test)
# - 9 conformance tests
```
