# Home Profile Smoke Proof Bundle Template

Required generated artifacts

- environment.md — hardware and OS summary per `.docs/HOME_PROFILE_TARGET.md`
- smoke_report.md — list of endpoints/commands checked and results
- logs_redacted/ — relevant logs

Notes

- This is the minimal acceptance gate per Home Profile.

Path layout

- <crate>/.proof_bundle/home-profile-smoke/<run_id>/
- run_id should be `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<git_sha8>` or set `LLORCH_RUN_ID`.

Environment

- LLORCH_RUN_ID — optional, groups artifacts per run
- LLORCH_PROOF_DIR — optional, overrides base bundle dir (defaults to `<crate>/.proof_bundle`)

Formats

- Markdown for `environment.md` and `smoke_report.md`; directory of redacted logs

Autogenerated header (required)

- Markdown/plain-text: first line MUST be `# AUTOGENERATED: Proof Bundle`.
- NDJSON: first record SHOULD be `{ "_meta": "proof_bundle", "_note": "autogenerated" }` when streams are present.
- JSON: prefer sibling `<name>.meta` file with the header line; embedding `{ "generated_by": "proof-bundle" }` is acceptable when JSON artifacts are produced.

Guidance

- `environment.md` should summarize CPU, RAM, disk, GPU model/driver, OS version, and relevant kernel params.
- `smoke_report.md` should list the exact probes run (CLI commands/endpoints) and their results.

- See `.docs/testing/types/smoke.md` and `.docs/testing/TEST_TYPES_GUIDE.md`.
