# observability-narration-core â€” Shared Narration Helper

Status: Draft
Owner: @llama-orch-maintainers

Purpose
- Provide a tiny, dependency-light helper to attach a `human` narration string alongside structured tracing fields.
- Unify narration across `orchestratord`, provisioners, adapters, and manager.

Spec Links
- `.specs/proposals/2025-09-19-human-narration-logging.md` (ORCH-33xx)

Detailed behavior (High / Mid / Low)

- High-level
  - Offers a small facade to emit human-readable narration strings co-located with structured fields.
  - Keeps a consistent taxonomy of fields across crates (see `README_LLM.md`).

- Mid-level
  - Provides helpers for common emission points: admission, placement, stream start/end, cancel.
  - Redaction utilities ensure secrets are never present in narration; integrates with error taxonomy.
  - Optional capture adapter enables tests/BDD to assert narration presence and content.

- Low-level
  - Minimal dependencies to remain usable by CLIs and provisioners; integrates with `tracing` when available.
  - Outputs are structured-first; narration string is an adjunct field (e.g., `human`).

Refinement Opportunities
- Add test capture adapter for BDD assertions.
- Add redaction helpers and taxonomy constants.
