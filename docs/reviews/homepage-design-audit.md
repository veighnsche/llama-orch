## Design Analysis (In Progress)

### Layout & Hierarchy

**Hero Section (Desktop Dark):**
- ‚úÖ **Commanding presence:** Full viewport height hero with clear focal point
- ‚úÖ **CTA above fold:** Primary yellow CTA immediately visible, strong contrast
- ‚úÖ **Terminal visual:** Right-side terminal mockup adds authenticity, shows product in action
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Navigation density:** 7 nav links may be too many for clarity - consider grouping or prioritizing
- ‚úÖ **Vertical rhythm:** Good spacing between headline, subhead, bullets, CTAs

**Issues Found:**
- [P2] Navigation has 7 top-level items (Features, Use Cases, Pricing, Developers, Providers, Enterprise, Docs) - consider mega-menu or consolidation
- [P3] Badge row at bottom of hero ("Star on GitHub", "API", etc.) uses small text - may not scan well

**WhatIsRbee Section (Desktop Dark):**
- ‚úÖ **3D illustration:** Authentic, on-brand, shows local network concept perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Stat blocks:** "$0", "100%", "All" format is scannable and impactful
- ‚úÖ **Emoji branding:** Bee emoji reinforces rbee name
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pronunciation guide:** Small text, might be missed - consider making it more prominent or moving to hero
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stat block design:** Three separate boxes feel disconnected - could use visual connector or unified container

**AudienceSelector Section (Desktop Dark):**
- ‚úÖ **Three-path segmentation:** Clear persona targeting (Developer, GPU Owner, Enterprise)
- ‚úÖ **Color coding:** Blue/Teal/Orange creates visual distinction between paths
- ‚úÖ **Benefit-first headlines:** "Code with AI locally", "Earn from idle GPUs", "Deploy with compliance" are action-oriented
- [P2] **Card equality:** All three cards same visual weight‚Äîconsider emphasizing primary target persona
- [P3] **"Homelab-ready" badge:** Only on Developer card‚Äîinconsistent if other paths also homelab-ready

**Overall Page Flow (Desktop Dark):**
- ‚úÖ **Narrative arc:** Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí How ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Proof ‚Üí Pricing ‚Üí FAQ ‚Üí CTA follows classic SaaS structure
- ‚úÖ **Consistent theming:** Orange/yellow accent colors maintained throughout
- ‚úÖ **Visual variety:** Alternating backgrounds (dark/secondary) creates rhythm
- ‚úÖ **3D illustrations:** High-quality, consistent style, reinforce brand identity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Section length:** Some sections very tall (HowItWorks 1748px, Pricing 1654px)‚Äîmay lose mobile users
- [P1] **Repeated messaging:** "Zero API fees", "OpenAI-compatible", "Your hardware" appears 10+ times‚Äîgood for reinforcement but could consolidate

### Typography

**Desktop Dark Mode Observations:**
- ‚úÖ **H1 scale:** "AI Infrastructure. On Your Terms." is large, bold, commanding
- ‚úÖ **Accent treatment:** Orange color on key phrases ("On Your Terms", "Your Control", "AI Infrastructure") creates emphasis
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchy clear:** H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 scale is consistent across sections
- ‚úÖ **Body text:** Readable contrast in dark mode, good line length
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Small text:** Pronunciation guide "(pronounced 'are-bee')" and some badge text very small‚Äîmay not be legible at distance
- [P2] **Line length:** Some body paragraphs in features/solution sections exceed 80 characters‚Äîconsider max-width constraint
- [P3] **Weight consistency:** Mix of semibold/bold in headlines‚Äîverify intentional vs. inconsistent token usage

### Color & Tokens

**Color Palette Observed:**
- **Primary accent:** Orange (#FF8C00 or similar)‚Äîused for "On Your Terms", badges, CTA highlights
- **Secondary accent:** Yellow (#FDB913 or similar)‚Äîprimary CTA buttons
- **Teal/Cyan:** Used for "None" indicators in comparison table, positive stats
- **Background:** Very dark navy (#0A0F1E or similar)
- **Secondary background:** Slightly lighter slate (#1A2332 or similar)
- **Text:** White/light gray for primary text, muted gray for secondary

**Token Alignment:**
- ‚úÖ **Consistent accent usage:** Orange/yellow appears intentionally across CTAs, badges, headings
- ‚úÖ **Background alternation:** Dark/secondary creates visual rhythm
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **One-off colors:** Persona cards (blue, teal, orange, purple) may be ad-hoc‚Äîverify these map to design tokens
- [P2] **Gradient usage:** Some 3D illustrations have gradients‚Äîensure these don't conflict with flat UI elsewhere
- [P3] **Border colors:** Various border treatments (orange, teal, default)‚Äîconsolidate to token-based system

### Components & Repetition

**Repeated Patterns (Potential Consolidation):**
1. **Feature cards:** Appear in AudienceSelector (3 cards), UseCasesSection (4 cards), Pricing (3 cards)‚Äîcould be unified `<FeatureCard>` molecule
2. **Stat blocks:** "$0", "100%", "All" in WhatIsRbee; "1,200+", "500+", "8,000+", "‚Ç¨0" in SocialProof‚Äîunified `<StatBlock>` atom
3. **Code blocks:** HowItWorks (2 blocks), FeaturesSection (1 block), CTASection (1 snippet)‚Äîunified `<CodeBlock>` molecule with copy button
4. **Badge pills:** Orange badges appear in 8+ sections‚Äîunified `<Badge>` atom with variants (primary, secondary, success)
5. **Testimonial cards:** SocialProof section‚Äîcould be `<TestimonialCard>` molecule
6. **CTA buttons:** Yellow primary, ghost secondary‚Äîappears consistent but verify all use same `<Button>` component

**Near-Duplicates Found:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Two different CTA styles:** "Get Started Free" (yellow button) vs "View Docs" (ghost) vs "Join Waitlist" (nav, yellow)‚Äîall CTAs, but different hierarchies. Intentional or inconsistent?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Badge variations:** Some badges have dots (orange), some don't‚Äîverify design system intent
- [P2] **Icon treatment:** Some icons circular background, some not‚Äîconsolidate

**Missing Molecules/Organisms:**
- [ ] `<FeatureCard>` - Reusable card for personas, use cases, pricing tiers
- [ ] `<StatBlock>` - Number + label combo
- [ ] `<CodeBlock>` - Syntax-highlighted code with copy button
- [ ] `<TestimonialCard>` - Avatar + name + role + quote + optional badge
- [ ] `<ComparisonTable>` - Feature comparison grid
- [ ] `<AccordionItem>` - FAQ accordion item

### Imagery & Motion

**3D Illustrations:**
- ‚úÖ **WhatIsRbee:** Isometric network of gaming PCs with RGB lighting and orange cables‚Äîauthentic, on-brand
- ‚úÖ **ProblemSection:** Rate limit gate visualization with padlock and warning triangles‚Äîclear metaphor
- ‚úÖ **CTASection:** Hexagonal server nodes on blueprint‚Äîreinforces technical/architectural theme
- ‚úÖ **FAQSection:** Person at desk with servers and question mark‚Äîrelatable help imagery
- ‚úÖ **Consistency:** All 3D art shares warm lighting, orange accent color, isometric/low-poly style
- [P3] **Hero terminal:** Could be animated (typing effect, progress bars filling)‚Äîcurrently static
- [P3] **Architecture diagram:** Could show data flow animation in SolutionSection

**Motion Present:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited motion detected:** Page appears mostly static
- [ ] **Potential motion opportunities:** Hero terminal typing, architecture diagram data flow, stat counter animations, testimonial carousel
- ‚úÖ **If adding motion:** All achievable via `tw-animate-css` (fadeIn, slideInUp, pulse, etc.)‚Äîno external libs needed

**Imagery Gaps:**
- [P2] **No team/founder photos:** SocialProof uses avatar circles but not real photos‚Äîconsider adding authenticity
- [P2] **No product screenshots:** All visuals are 3D art or code‚Äîconsider actual UI screenshots of Web UI (Team tier feature)
- [P3] **Placeholder concern:** 3D art is high-quality, not generic placeholders‚Äîgood

### Accessibility

**Positive Elements:**
- ‚úÖ **Color contrast:** White text on dark navy backgrounds passes WCAG AA
- ‚úÖ **Heading hierarchy:** Proper H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 structure observed
- ‚úÖ **CTA affordance:** Yellow buttons have clear visual weight and appear clickable

**Issues & Gaps:**
- [P1] **Alt text unknown:** Cannot verify from visual inspection‚Äîmust check markup for descriptive alt on 3D illustrations
- [P1] **Focus states:** Not visible in screenshots‚Äîmust test keyboard navigation to verify rings/outlines
- [P2] **Link affordance:** "View Repository", "See how rbee restores control" are text links‚Äîensure underline/hover state
- [P2] **Icon-only buttons:** Theme toggle appears icon-only‚Äîmust have aria-label
- [P3] **Color-only meaning:** Comparison table uses checkmarks/X + color (teal/red)‚Äîsymbols help but verify for colorblind users
- [P3] **Motion preference:** If motion added, must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [P3] **Skip links:** Not visible‚Äîshould have skip-to-main for keyboard users

**ARIA & Landmarks:**
- Cannot verify from visual inspection‚Äîaudit needed for: `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section aria-labelledby>`, button roles, expanded states on accordions

### Responsiveness (Desktop 1440√ó900 Only So Far)

**Desktop Observations:**
- ‚úÖ **Safe margins:** Content well-contained, no edge bleeding
- ‚úÖ **Grid consistency:** Multi-column layouts (3-col personas, 4-col use cases, comparison table) render cleanly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminal mockup:** Right-side terminal in hero is large‚Äîwill need significant adaptation for tablet/mobile
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code blocks:** Wide code snippets in HowItWorks‚Äîmay overflow on mobile
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Comparison table:** 5-column table will be challenging on mobile‚Äîlikely needs horizontal scroll or card stacking

**Pending Tablet/Mobile Testing:**
- [ ] 834√ó1112 (tablet): Test terminal mockup, comparison table, feature grids
- [ ] 390√ó844 (mobile): Test navigation collapse, hero CTA placement, code block overflow

### Content & Story

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ **Independence narrative:** "Your Hardware. Your Models. Your Control." is consistent
- ‚úÖ **Zero-cost emphasis:** "$0", "Zero API fees", "No credit card required" repeated effectively
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI-compatible hook:** Drop-in replacement messaging lowers switching friction
- ‚úÖ **Technical credibility:** BDD coverage, Rust-native, architecture diagrams signal serious engineering
- ‚úÖ **Use case variety:** Solo dev, small team, homelab, enterprise‚Äîcovers spectrum

**What's Missing (Story Gaps):**
1. **[P1] "Use ALL your home GPUs" undersold:** Headline says "AI Infrastructure. On Your Terms." but doesn't explicitly call out "every GPU in your home network" until section 6 (5063px down). Hero should lead with "Turn every GPU in your home into an AI cluster."
2. **[P1] Independence from OpenAI not explicit enough:** Problem section mentions "vendor lock-in" generically but doesn't name OpenAI/Anthropic as the specific threat in hero. Subhead should say "Break free from OpenAI rate limits."
3. **[P2] Risk reversal weak:** "No credit card required" appears once. Add: "Cancel anytime", "100% open source = zero vendor lock", "Your data never leaves your network."
4. **[P2] Proof point timing:** Testimonials with "$80/mo ‚Üí $0" savings appear at 13461px. Move one testimonial to hero area for immediate credibility.
5. **[P3] "rbee" pronunciation buried:** "(pronounced 'are-bee')" is tiny text in section 2. Move to hero or nav as tooltip.
6. **[P3] Time-to-value unclear:** "15 minutes" appears in section 7 and final CTA but not hero. Hero should promise "15-minute setup."

**Redundancies (Good Reinforcement, But Could Trim):**
- "OpenAI-compatible API" appears: Hero badges, What is rbee, Solution pills, Features tab, Comparison table, Pricing, CTA badges (7 times)
- "Zero API fees" appears: Hero bullets, What is rbee stat, Solution pills, Comparison table, Features badges, Social proof, CTA (7 times)
- Could consolidate by removing from middle sections, keeping in hero, pricing, and CTA

**Tone & Voice:**
- ‚úÖ **Engineer-to-engineer:** Technical language (BDD, Rhai, process isolation) appropriate for target audience
- ‚úÖ **Confidence:** "Enterprise-Grade Features. Homelab Simplicity." is bold claim backed by features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Jargon balance:** "Rhai-based policies", "Candle ML", "Axum" may alienate non-Rust devs‚Äîconsider glossary or tooltips

## Stakeholder Story (Observed ‚Üí Proposed)

### Observed Message

The current homepage presents **rbee** as an open-source AI orchestration platform that unifies home/office hardware into an OpenAI-compatible cluster. The promise is **independence** ("On Your Terms"), **zero API costs** (run on your own hardware), and **drop-in compatibility** (replace OpenAI with a URL change). The page targets three personas‚Äîdevelopers, GPU owners, and enterprises‚Äîwith technical depth (Rust, BDD, architecture diagrams) and social proof (testimonials showing $500/mo ‚Üí $0 savings).

### Gaps

1. **Hero doesn't lead with "ALL your home GPUs":** The unique value‚Äîorchestrating every GPU across gaming rigs, workstations, and Macs‚Äîis buried in section 6. Hero says "Run LLMs on your hardware" but doesn't emphasize the multi-GPU, multi-machine orchestration.
2. **OpenAI pain point not explicit enough:** "Vendor lock-in" is generic. Hero should call out OpenAI rate limits, pricing changes, and API deprecations by name.
3. **Time-to-value hidden:** "15-minute setup" appears late. Hero should front-load this to lower perceived effort.
4. **Risk reversal weak:** "No credit card required" is good but not enough. Need "100% open source = walk away anytime", "Your data never touches the cloud."
5. **Proof delayed:** First testimonial at 13461px. Hero needs one social proof element above fold.

### Proposed Message (Ready-to-Paste Copy)

#### Headline (H1)
**"Turn Every GPU in Your Home into a Private AI Cluster. 15 Minutes."**

**Rationale:** Leads with the unique multi-GPU orchestration hook + time-to-value. "Private" signals independence. "15 Minutes" lowers barrier.

#### Subhead (Below H1)
**"Break free from OpenAI rate limits and surprise pricing. rbee orchestrates LLMs across your gaming rigs, workstations, and Macs‚Äîgiving you an OpenAI-compatible API with zero monthly cost and zero data exfiltration."**

**Rationale:** Names the competitor (OpenAI), states the pain (rate limits, pricing), promises the solution (multi-machine orchestration + drop-in API), and delivers the benefits ($0 cost, data stays local).

#### Primary CTA
**"Get Started Free ‚Üí"**  
*Microcopy:* "Open source. No credit card. Ready in 15 min."

**Rationale:** Keeps existing CTA but strengthens microcopy with three objection-handlers.

#### Support Blocks (Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Proof)

**Block 1: Problem (Why now?)**  
*"OpenAI just changed pricing again. Anthropic rate-limited your team. You're burning $500/month on APIs you can't control."*

**Block 2: Solution (What is rbee?)**  
*"rbee is an open-source orchestrator that pools every CUDA, Metal, and CPU device on your network into one private AI cluster. Drop-in OpenAI API compatibility means zero code changes‚Äîjust point your tools (Cursor, Zed, Continue) to localhost:8080."*

**Block 3: Proof (Who's using it?)**  
*"Solo devs cut AI costs from $80/month to $0. Startups saved $6,000/year by pooling team hardware. Enterprises met GDPR by keeping inference on-prem. 1,200+ GitHub stars. 8,000+ GPUs orchestrated."*

## Implementation Handoff (For StyleBee)

### Top 5 P1 Issues (Fix First)

1. **[P1] Hero headline undersells unique value**  
   - **Current:** "AI Infrastructure. On Your Terms."  
   - **Fix:** "Turn Every GPU in Your Home into a Private AI Cluster. 15 Minutes."  
   - **Screenshot:** `hero_desktop_dark.png` (line 1, headline)  
   - **Why:** Current headline is generic. Unique selling proposition is multi-GPU/multi-machine orchestration + speed. Competitors (Ollama) are single-machine.

2. **[P1] OpenAI pain point not named in hero**  
   - **Current:** Subhead says "Build with AI, keep control, and avoid vendor lock-in."  
   - **Fix:** "Break free from OpenAI rate limits and surprise pricing. rbee orchestrates LLMs across your gaming rigs, workstations, and Macs‚Äîgiving you an OpenAI-compatible API with zero monthly cost."  
   - **Screenshot:** `hero_desktop_dark.png` (line 2, subhead)  
   - **Why:** "Vendor lock-in" is generic. Target audience is already on OpenAI and frustrated with recent pricing/rate limit changes. Name the competitor.

3. **[P1] Proof delayed 13,000px**  
   - **Current:** First testimonial at SocialProofSection (13461px down)  
   - **Fix:** Add one testimonial card to hero area (below CTA buttons). Use Alex K.: "$80/mo ‚Üí $0" with avatar.  
   - **Screenshot:** `hero_desktop_dark.png` (add below fold) + `section-11-socialproof_desktop_dark.png` (source)  
   - **Why:** Social proof above fold increases conversion. Testimonial reinforces "$0" claim immediately.

4. **[P1] Missing alt text on 3D illustrations**  
   - **Current:** Cannot verify from screenshots but likely missing descriptive alt  
   - **Fix:** Add descriptive alt to ALL 3D images that also serves as generation prompt. Example: "Isometric 3D render of three gaming PCs with RGB lighting connected by glowing orange network cables on a dark background, representing a local GPU cluster."  
   - **Screenshots:** `section-01-whatisrbee_desktop_dark.png`, `section-04-problem_desktop_dark.png`, `section-14-cta_desktop_dark.png`  
   - **Why:** Accessibility (screen readers) + provides clear generation prompts for future image updates.

5. **[P1] Focus states missing visual confirmation**  
   - **Current:** Cannot see focus rings in screenshots  
   - **Fix:** Verify all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have visible focus states. Use Tailwind's `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange-500 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-background`.  
   - **Test:** Keyboard navigation through hero section  
   - **Why:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance + keyboard users need visual feedback.

### Sections to Rebuild vs. Tune

**Rebuild (Structural Changes):**
- **Hero (HeroSection):** Rewrite copy (H1, subhead), add testimonial card, restructure CTA microcopy. Keep terminal mockup visual.
- **Pricing (PricingSection):** Current cards work but consider extracting unified `<PricingCard>` component from `<FeatureCard>` to reduce prop bloat.

**Tune (Copy/Style Tweaks):**
- **WhatIsRbee:** Move pronunciation guide to hero or make tooltip on logo. Unify stat blocks into connected container.
- **AudienceSelector:** Emphasize primary target (likely Developer) with larger card or "Recommended" badge.
- **Problem:** Good as-is. Consider shortening body copy.
- **Solution:** Good as-is. Optional: add subtle animation to architecture diagram (data flow lines).
- **HowItWorks:** Good structure. Add overflow handling for code blocks on mobile.
- **Features:** Good. Verify other tabs (Multi-GPU, Scheduler, Real-time) have content.
- **UseCases:** Good. Ensure all 4 personas have equal visual weight.
- **Comparison:** Table will break on mobile. Rebuild as card stack for <768px.
- **SocialProof:** Move one testimonial to hero. Rest good as-is.
- **Technical:** Good for engineer audience. Consider glossary tooltips on jargon (Rhai, Candle, Axum).
- **FAQ:** Good. Ensure search works and accordion is keyboard-accessible.
- **CTA:** Good. Verify code snippet has syntax highlighting.

### Components to Consolidate

**Immediate Extractions:**
1. **`<FeatureCard>`** - Used in AudienceSelector (3), UseCases (4), Pricing (3) with variants  
   - Props: `icon`, `iconBg`, `eyebrow`, `headline`, `body`, `bullets[]`, `cta`, `badge?`  
   - Variants: `default`, `highlighted` (orange border), `compact`

2. **`<StatBlock>`** - Used in WhatIsRbee (3), SocialProof (4), CTA (3)  
   - Props: `value`, `label`, `color` (orange|teal|white)  
   - Variants: `large` (hero), `medium` (sections)

3. **`<CodeBlock>`** - Used in HowItWorks (2), Features (1), CTA (1)  
   - Props: `code`, `language`, `filename?`, `highlightLines?`, `showCopy`  
   - Variants: `inline` (CTA snippet), `full` (HowItWorks)

4. **`<Badge>`** - Used in 14+ sections  
   - Props: `text`, `variant` (primary|secondary|success), `icon?`, `dot?`  
   - Verify all use same component vs. ad-hoc spans

**Lower Priority:**
- `<TestimonialCard>` - Only used once (SocialProof), extract when reused
- `<ComparisonTable>` - Needs mobile refactor, extract after responsive fix
- `<AccordionItem>` - FAQ-specific, extract if reused elsewhere

### Copy Blocks Ready to Paste

**Hero H1:**
```
Turn Every GPU in Your Home into a Private AI Cluster. 15 Minutes.
```

**Hero Subhead:**
```
Break free from OpenAI rate limits and surprise pricing. rbee orchestrates LLMs across your gaming rigs, workstations, and Macs‚Äîgiving you an OpenAI-compatible API with zero monthly cost and zero data exfiltration.
```

**Hero CTA Microcopy:**
```
Open source. No credit card. Ready in 15 min.
```

**Hero Testimonial (Add Below CTAs):**
```
"Used to pay $80/mo for coding. Now Llama 70B runs locally on my gaming PC + an old workstation. Same quality, $0/month. Not going back."
‚Äî Alex K., Solo Developer
[$80/mo ‚Üí $0 badge]
```

**WhatIsRbee Pronunciation (Add to Logo Tooltip or Badge):**
```
rbee (pronounced "are-bee")
```

### Imagery Directives

**Generate/Replace:**
1. **Hero testimonial avatar** - Need real photo or illustrated avatar for Alex K. (solo dev persona). Current: yellow circle placeholder in SocialProof. Generate: "Professional headshot of a software developer at desk with laptop, warm lighting, looking confident."

2. **Team tier product screenshot** - Pricing card mentions "Web UI for cluster & models" but no screenshot exists. Generate: "Screenshot of modern dark-mode web dashboard showing GPU cluster status, with node health indicators, model list, and real-time metrics. Clean UI with orange accents, resembling Vercel or Railway dashboard style."

3. **Optional: Founder/team photo** - SocialProof section could benefit from "Built by engineers who value independence" with actual founder photo. Generate: "Software engineer at desk with homelab GPU rack in background, warm lighting, authentic workspace."

**Keep As-Is:**
- All 3D illustrations (WhatIsRbee, Problem, Solution, CTA, FAQ) are high-quality and on-brand
- Terminal mockup in hero is excellent‚Äîshows real output

**Next.js `<Image>` Optimization:**
Add `<Image>` component with descriptive alt for:
- All 3D illustrations (5 images): `priority={true}` for hero terminal, `loading="lazy"` for others
- Testimonial avatars (3 images): `loading="lazy"`, `width={48}`, `height={48}`
- Future: Team tier screenshot, founder photo

**Alt Text Template (Doubles as Gen Prompt):**
```typescript
// Example for WhatIsRbee illustration
<Image
  src="/images/local-network-cluster.png"
  alt="Isometric 3D illustration of three gaming PCs with glowing RGB fans connected by orange network cables on a dark background, representing a local GPU orchestration cluster"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  loading="lazy"
/>
```
