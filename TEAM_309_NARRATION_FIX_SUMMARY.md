# TEAM-309: Narration Visibility Fix Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Impact:** All narration now visible in rbee-keeper CLI

---

## Problem

`./rbee-keeper self-check` showed NO narration output. All 10 test narrations were invisible.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Path

1. **Read debugging-rules.md** (mandatory before fixing bugs)
2. **Ran self-check** - confirmed zero narration output
3. **Traced code path:**
   - `n!()` macro → `macro_emit()` → `narrate()` → `narrate_at_level()` → `emit.rs`
4. **Found TEAM-299 privacy fix:**
   - Lines 77-103 in `emit.rs` removed ALL stderr output
   - Reason: Multi-tenant privacy/security (correct for queen-rbee server)
5. **Checked `privacy_isolation_tests.rs`:**
   - Confirms NO stderr by design
   - Tests explicitly verify no environment variables can bypass this
6. **Discovered narration routing:**
   - SSE sink (requires job_id for routing)
   - Tracing subscribers (requires setup)
   - Capture adapter (for tests only)
7. **Identified gap:**
   - `rbee-keeper self-check` has NO SSE channel (standalone CLI)
   - NO job_id (not job-scoped)
   - NO tracing subscriber configured

### Root Cause

**rbee-keeper CLI had NO tracing subscriber configured.**

Narration was being emitted correctly but had nowhere visible to go:
- ❌ SSE sink dropped it (no job_id)
- ❌ Tracing had no subscriber (nothing listening)
- ✅ Capture adapter worked (but invisible to users)

**This is NOT a bug in narration-core.** It's a missing integration in rbee-keeper.

## The Fix

### Files Changed

**1. `bin/00_rbee_keeper/Cargo.toml`**
- Added `tracing = "0.1"`
- Added `tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter", "fmt"] }`

**2. `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/main.rs`**
- Added 54-line bug fix documentation (lines 111-145)
- Added tracing subscriber initialization (lines 147-163)
- Only for CLI mode (not GUI mode)

### Implementation

```rust
// TEAM-309: Set up tracing subscriber for CLI narration visibility
use tracing_subscriber::{fmt, EnvFilter};
use tracing_subscriber::fmt::format::FmtSpan;

fmt()
    .with_env_filter(
        EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()
            .unwrap_or_else(|_| EnvFilter::new("info"))
    )
    .with_target(false)      // Don't show module paths
    .with_level(false)       // Don't show log levels
    .with_span_events(FmtSpan::NONE)  // Don't show span events
    .with_ansi(true)         // Enable colors
    .with_timer(fmt::time::uptime())  // Show time since start
    .init();
```

### Why This Is Safe

**rbee-keeper is a single-user, isolated process:**
- ✅ Not multi-tenant (unlike queen-rbee server)
- ✅ Each invocation is isolated (separate process)
- ✅ No cross-job contamination possible
- ✅ No privacy violation (TEAM-299 concerns don't apply)

**TEAM-299's privacy fix remains valid:**
- ✅ queen-rbee server has NO stderr output (correct)
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation preserved (SSE-only)
- ✅ Security by design enforced (no exploitable code paths)

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```bash
$ ./target/debug/rbee-keeper self-check

🔍 rbee-keeper Self-Check
==================================================

📝 Test 1: Simple Narration

📝 Test 2: Narration with Variables

# ... (NO narration output visible)
```

### After Fix
```bash
$ ./target/debug/rbee-keeper self-check

🔍 rbee-keeper Self-Check
==================================================

📝 Test 1: Simple Narration
[rbee-keeper ] self_check_start: Starting rbee-keeper self-check

📝 Test 2: Narration with Variables
[rbee-keeper ] version_check  : Checking rbee-keeper version 0.1.0

📝 Test 3: Human Mode (default)
[rbee-keeper ] mode_test      : Testing narration in human mode

📝 Test 4: Cute Mode
[rbee-keeper ] mode_test      : 🐝 Testing narration in cute mode!

# ... (ALL narration output visible in clean format)
```

### Verification Checklist

- ✅ All 10 test narrations visible
- ✅ Actor correctly set to "rbee-keeper" (not "unknown")
- ✅ Clean format: `[actor] action: message` (matches original design)
- ✅ Human mode displays correctly
- ✅ Cute mode displays correctly (🐝 emoji)
- ✅ Story mode displays correctly
- ✅ Format specifiers work (hex, debug, float)
- ✅ Sequential narrations all appear
- ✅ Config check shows queen URL
- ✅ Partial mode combinations work
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ No new warnings introduced

## Impact

### User Experience

**Before:**
- ❌ Narration invisible in CLI
- ❌ Users couldn't see what system was doing
- ❌ Debugging impossible

**After:**
- ✅ All narration visible
- ✅ Users see real-time feedback
- ✅ Debugging information available

### Code Health

- **Lines Added:** ~140 LOC (Cargo.toml + main.rs + self_check.rs)
- **Lines Removed:** 0 LOC
- **Complexity:** Medium (custom tracing formatter + context wrapper)
- **Maintenance:** Minimal (uses standard Rust ecosystem)

### Custom Formatter

**Files Changed:**
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/main.rs` - Added `NarrationFormatter` struct (70 LOC)

**Desired Format (from narration-core/src/api/emit.rs:83):**
```rust
// Original format before TEAM-299 privacy fix:
eprintln!("[{:<10}] {:<15}: {}", fields.actor, fields.action, message);
```

**Implementation:**
```rust
struct NarrationFormatter;

impl<S, N> FormatEvent<S, N> for NarrationFormatter {
    fn format_event(&self, ...) -> std::fmt::Result {
        // Extract actor, action, human from tracing event
        // Format: [actor     ] action         : message
        writeln!(writer, "[{:<12}] {:<15}: {}", actor, action, human)
    }
}
```

**Result:** Clean, readable format matching original design

### Actor Context Pattern

**Files Changed:**
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/self_check.rs` - Wrapped in `NarrationContext` with actor

**Pattern:**
```rust
let ctx = NarrationContext::new()
    .with_actor("rbee-keeper");

with_narration_context(ctx, async {
    // All n!() calls inside automatically use actor="rbee-keeper"
    n!("action", "message");
}).await
```

**Result:** All narrations show `actor="rbee-keeper"` instead of `actor="unknown"`

## Architecture Alignment

### TEAM-299 Privacy Fix

**Preserved and respected:**
- ✅ No stderr output in narration-core
- ✅ SSE is primary output for multi-tenant server
- ✅ Job-scoped isolation enforced
- ✅ No exploitable code paths
- ✅ Security by design maintained

### New Pattern

**CLI tools need tracing subscriber:**
- rbee-keeper ✅ (fixed)
- rbee-hive (may need same fix if has narration)
- llm-worker (may need same fix if has narration)

### Future Work

Consider extracting tracing setup to shared utility:
- `bin/99_shared_crates/cli-tracing/`
- Reusable across all CLI binaries
- Consistent format/behavior
