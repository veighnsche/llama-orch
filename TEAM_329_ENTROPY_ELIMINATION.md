# TEAM-329: Entropy Elimination - spawn() vs start_daemon()

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Rule:** RULE ZERO - Breaking changes > backwards compatibility  
**Problem:** Naming confusion between `spawn()` and `start_daemon()`

## The Problem

Two functions appeared to be alternatives, but they weren't:

- **`manager.spawn()`** - Low-level: spawn process + auto-update
- **`start_daemon()`** - High-level: spawn + health poll + PID file + detach

**The drift:** `start_daemon()` called `spawn()` internally, but the naming suggested they were alternatives.

## The Solution

**RULE ZERO:** Breaking changes > backwards compatibility

### Changes Made

1. **Inlined `spawn()` logic into `start_daemon()`**
   - All spawn logic now directly in `start.rs:start_daemon()`
   - No intermediate wrapper function
   - Single source of truth

2. **Deleted `DaemonManager` struct**
   - Was only a wrapper around `spawn()` + `find_binary()`
   - Converted `find_binary()` to standalone function
   - No need for struct with single useful method

3. **Updated all imports**
   - `daemon_lifecycle::DaemonManager` → `daemon_lifecycle::find_binary`
   - Compiler found all call sites instantly

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/start.rs` (+30 LOC)
  - Inlined spawn logic with all historical context preserved
  - TEAM-164: Stdio::null() fix
  - TEAM-189: SSH agent propagation
  - TEAM-329: Entropy elimination

- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/manager.rs` (-75 LOC)
  - Deleted `DaemonManager` struct
  - Deleted `spawn()` method
  - Converted `find_binary()` to standalone function
  - Comprehensive deletion comments explaining why

- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/install.rs` (1 line)
  - Updated to use standalone `find_binary()`

- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` (1 line)
  - Export `find_binary` instead of `DaemonManager`

### Broken (Intentionally)
- `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/start.rs`
  - Uses deleted `DaemonManager::new().spawn()`
  - **MUST be refactored** - worker-lifecycle is just reimplementing daemon-lifecycle

- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/tests/stdio_null_tests.rs`
  - Tests for deleted `spawn()` method
  - **MUST be updated** to test `start_daemon()` instead

## Why This Matters

### Before (Entropy)
```rust
// Two ways to do the same thing?
let manager = DaemonManager::new(path, args);
let child = manager.spawn().await?;  // Low-level?

// Or...
let pid = start_daemon(config).await?;  // High-level?
```

**Confusion:** Are these alternatives? Which should I use?

### After (Clean)
```rust
// One way to start a daemon
let pid = start_daemon(config).await?;

// One way to find a binary
let path = find_binary("queen-rbee")?;
```

**Clear:** `start_daemon()` is the way. `find_binary()` is a helper.

## Compilation Status

✅ **daemon-lifecycle:** PASS (2 warnings, 0 errors)  
❌ **worker-lifecycle:** FAIL (uses deleted API)  
❌ **stdio_null_tests:** FAIL (tests deleted method)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix worker-lifecycle** - Should use `start_daemon()` or implement its own spawn logic
2. **Update tests** - Test `start_daemon()` instead of deleted `spawn()`
3. **Document pattern** - This is the correct way to eliminate entropy

## Key Insight

**Entropy kills projects.** Every "backwards compatible" wrapper function:
- Doubles maintenance burden
- Confuses contributors
- Creates permanent technical debt

**Breaking changes are temporary pain.** The compiler finds all call sites in 30 seconds. You fix them. Done.

**This is RULE ZERO in action.**
