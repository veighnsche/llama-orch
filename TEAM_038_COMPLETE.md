## 🎯 Narration Scenarios Added to BDD

### Scenario 1: MVP-001 Cold Start with Narration
```gherkin
And user sees narration on stderr:
  """
  [rbee-hive] 🌅 Starting pool manager on port 9200
  [model-provisioner] 📦 Downloading model from Hugging Face
  [llm-worker-rbee] 🌅 Worker starting on port 8001
  [device-manager] 🖥️ Initialized Metal device 0
  [model-loader] 🛏️ Model loaded! 669 MB cozy in VRAM!
  [candle-backend] 🚀 Starting inference
  [candle-backend] 🎉 Inference complete! 20 tokens in 150ms
  """
And user sees tokens on stdout:
  """
  Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a curious cat...
  """
```

### Scenario 2: MVP-002 Warm Start with Narration
```gherkin
And user sees narration on stderr:
  """
  [candle-backend] 🚀 Starting inference
  [tokenizer] 🍰 Tokenized prompt (3 tokens)
  [candle-backend] 🎯 Generated 10 tokens
  [candle-backend] 🎉 Inference complete! 20 tokens in 120ms
  """
And user sees tokens on stdout:
  """
  Roses are red, violets are blue, AI is cool, and so are you...
  """
```

### Scenario 3: Quiet Mode (NEW)
```gherkin
@mvp @narration
Scenario: MVP - Quiet mode suppresses narration
  When I run:
    """
    rbee-keeper infer --quiet ...
    """
  Then user sees NO narration on stderr
  And user sees ONLY tokens on stdout
```

### Scenario 4: Piping Tokens (NEW)
```gherkin
@mvp @narration
Scenario: MVP - Piping tokens preserves narration on stderr
  When I run:
    """
    rbee-keeper infer ... > output.txt
    """
  Then user sees narration on stderr
  And file "output.txt" contains ONLY tokens
  And narration does NOT appear in output.txt
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings Documented

### 1. Narration Architecture
**All narration is for the USER. Transport varies by HTTP server state:**
- Before HTTP ready: stdout → rbee-hive → SSE → queen-rbee → user
- During HTTP active: SSE → queen-rbee → user
- After HTTP closed: stdout → rbee-hive → SSE → queen-rbee → user

### 2. Display Rules
- **Narration → stderr** (user sees, doesn't interfere with piping)
- **Tokens → stdout** (AI agent can pipe)
- **--quiet flag** disables narration

### 3. Three-Tier Architecture
```
Tier 1: rbee-keeper (displays to user)
Tier 2: queen-rbee (aggregates narration)
Tier 3: rbee-hive + workers (emit narration)
```

### 4. Lifecycle Rules
- rbee-keeper: TESTING TOOL (ephemeral CLI)
- queen-rbee: ORCHESTRATOR (persistent daemon, port 8080)
- rbee-hive: POOL MANAGER (persistent daemon, port 9200)
- llm-worker-rbee: WORKER (persistent daemon, port 8001+)

2. Create SSE channel in execute handler
3. Modify `narrate()` for dual output
4. Implement rbee-hive stdout capture
5. Implement queen-rbee narration merging

**Priority 2: Update rbee-keeper (P0)**
1. Handle narration SSE events
2. Display narration to stderr
3. Display tokens to stdout
4. Add `--quiet` flag

**Priority 3: Implement BDD Step Definitions (P1)**
1. "user sees narration on stderr"
2. "user sees tokens on stdout"
3. "user sees NO narration on stderr"
4. "file contains ONLY tokens"

**Priority 4: Testing (P1)**
1. Unit tests for narration channel
2. Integration test: narration in SSE stream
3. Integration test: rbee-keeper displays narration
4. BDD tests: all narration scenarios pass
