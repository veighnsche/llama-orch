//! Preload and model warmup (planning-only).
//!
//! TODO: Implement preload orchestration that gates pool readiness.
//! Spec: ORCH-3002 (pools preload at startup, only Ready after success), ORCH-3003 (fail fast on insufficient VRAM/RAM).
//! Checklist: CHECKLIST.md "Preload & Readiness Gating" → "Model staging (via model-provisioner) + Engine preparation (via engine-provisioner) → ready=true only after healthy endpoint."
//! Usage: Called during pool initialization before marking ready=true.
//! Expected API:
//!   - `PreloadOutcome::execute(pool_id, model_ref, device_mask, registry: &mut Registry) -> Result<Self>`
//!   - Calls model-provisioner::ensure_present(model_ref) to stage model
//!   - Calls engine-provisioner::prepare(pool) to get PreparedEngine
//!   - Starts engine process/container and waits for health check
//!   - On success: registry.register_ready_from_handoff(pool_id, handoff) → ready=true
//!   - On failure: registry.set_last_error(pool_id, err) → ready=false
//! Integration: Wired by orchestratord bootstrap or pool-managerd daemon (not yet implemented).
//! Tests: BDD steps "pool is Unready due to preload failure" (test-harness/bdd/src/steps/pool_manager.rs:5-12).
//! Tests: Integration test "preload gates readiness" (CHECKLIST.md "Testing Strategy").
