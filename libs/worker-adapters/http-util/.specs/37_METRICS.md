# http-util — Metrics (v0)

Status: Draft
Owner: @llama-orch-maintainers
Date: 2025-09-19

## Emission

- This util does not emit metrics directly.

## Proof Bundle Outputs (MUST)

Use the support crate `libs/proof-bundle` and follow `.docs/testing/TEST_TYPES_GUIDE.md` and `libs/proof-bundle/.specs/00_proof-bundle.md` (PB‑1001..PB‑1012):

- Base path: `<crate>/.proof_bundle/integration/<run_id>/` (PB‑1001..PB‑1003). Respect `LLORCH_RUN_ID` and `LLORCH_PROOF_DIR`.
- Autogenerated header (PB‑1012): Markdown/CSV/text artifacts MUST begin with `# AUTOGENERATED: Proof Bundle`.

Even though this crate does not emit metrics, tests MUST generate the following artifact in the bundle:
- `metrics_note.md` — a short note (with the autogenerated header) confirming that http‑util does not emit metrics and pointing to adapter‑level metrics responsibilities per `/.specs/metrics/otel-prom.md`.

## Refinement Opportunities

- Consider exposing retry counters via callback hooks.
