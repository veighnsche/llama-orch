# Architecture Documentation Changelog

## v1.1 - Queen Build Configurations (Oct 23, 2025)

### Major Addition: Dual-Mode Queen Architecture

Added comprehensive documentation for queen-rbee's two build configurations:

#### 1. Distributed Queen (Default)
- All operations via HTTP (job-client)
- Manages remote hives
- ~5-10ms overhead per operation
- Requires separate rbee-hive binary

#### 2. Integrated Queen (local-hive feature)
- Direct Rust calls for localhost (~0.1ms)
- HTTP forwarding for remote hives (still available!)
- 50-100x faster localhost operations
- No separate rbee-hive binary needed

### Documentation Updates

- **NEW SECTION:** "Queen Build Configurations"
  - Distributed vs Integrated comparison
  - Use cases for each mode

  - Multi-Machine - Hybrid (production)
  - Multi-Machine - Pure Distributed
- **UPDATED:** "System Characteristics"
  - Performance comparison table (distributed vs integrated)
  - 50-100x speedup for localhost operations

#### Part 2: Component Deep Dive (01_COMPONENTS_PART_2.md)

  - NEW: Queen lifecycle management
  - NEW: Smart prompts for localhost optimization
- **UPDATED:** rbee-keeper command structure
  - NEW: `QueenCommands` enum
  - Commands: start, stop, status, rebuild, info
- **NEW:** Smart prompts example
  - Performance comparison display
  - Recommendation for local-hive rebuild

#### README.md Updates
- **UPDATED:** Part 1 summary
  - Added "Queen Build Configurations" topic
  - Added key insight about two queen modes
- **UPDATED:** Part 2 summary
  - Added NEW items for rbee-keeper and queen-rbee
  - Highlighted smart prompts and dual-mode forwarder
- **UPDATED:** Key Architectural Decisions
  - NEW: Queen Build Configurations decision
  - Benefits, smart recommendations, impact
- **UPDATED:** Common Pitfalls
  - NEW: Building queen without considering deployment
  - Example of suboptimal vs optimal builds
- **UPDATED:** Document History
  - Added v1.1 entry with all changes

### Key Benefits

1. **Performance:** 50-100x faster localhost operations with integrated mode
2. **Flexibility:** Same binary can manage both local and remote hives
3. **Simplicity:** One binary instead of two for single-machine setups
4. **User Experience:** Smart prompts guide users to optimal configuration
5. **Backward Compatibility:** Distributed mode still default, no breaking changes

### Implementation Status

- âœ… Architecture documented
- âœ… Use cases defined
- âœ… API design specified
- âœ… Smart prompts designed
- ðŸš§ Implementation pending (future work)

## Pending: Post-TEAM-261 Cleanup

### Status: ðŸš§ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION

**Trigger:** TEAM-261 heartbeat simplification exposed deprecated code

**See:** [CLEANUP_PLAN_TEAM261.md](CLEANUP_PLAN_TEAM261.md) for full details

### Summary of Cleanup Needed

1. **Delete Dead Code:**
   - `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-registry` (obsolete)
   - `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-ensure` (empty file)
   - `bin/99_shared_crates/hive-core` (unused)
   - Hive heartbeat logic in `bin/99_shared_crates/heartbeat/`

2. **Rename for Clarity:**
   - `hive-registry` â†’ `worker-registry` (reflects reality)
   - `SseBroadcaster` â†’ `SseChannelRegistry` (no longer broadcasts)

3. **New Features:**
   - Queen lifecycle management (install/uninstall)
   - Smart prompts for localhost optimization

**Impact:** ~910 LOC dead code removed, +200 LOC new features
