## Part 1: Product Identity (Based on Your Input)

### What is the product?
**Your description:**
> Run inference or any AI task (LLM, Stable Diffusion, Whisper, etc.) on every machine that you have an SSH connection to.

**Refined:**
> A multi-node GPU orchestration platform for running ANY AI task (LLM inference, image generation, speech recognition) across all machines in your network via SSH, with complete control over which GPU runs which model.

---

### Who is it for?
**Primary audience (your ranking):**
1. **Developers** - Build programs with agentic API and home LLM inference
2. **DevOps/SRE** - Set up private AI clusters for companies
3. **Startups** - Experiment with home AI using existing hardware

**Their pain point (your words):**
> "Not being able to pick which GPU runs which model. Not being able to have control over all the computer power in your network for inference or other AI tasks."

---

### What makes it unique?
**Key differentiators (your ranking):**
1. **Private/self-hosted** - YOUR network, YOUR control
2. **User-scriptable orchestration (Rhai)** - Program YOUR routing logic
3. **EU/Netherlands-based (GDPR compliance)** - Privacy-first
- Multi-architecture support (CUDA, Metal, CPU)
- SSH-based control (no cloud, no vendor lock-in)
- Open source (GPL-3.0)
- ANY AI task (not just LLMs)
