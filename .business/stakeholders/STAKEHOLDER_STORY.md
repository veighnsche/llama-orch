**🎯 PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCE:** Developers who build with AI but don't want to depend on big AI providers.

**THE FEAR:** You're building complex codebases with AI assistance. What if OpenAI/Anthropic changes their models, shuts down, or changes pricing? Your codebase becomes unmaintainable without AI.

**THE SOLUTION:** rbee gives you a local AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware. Build your own AI coders from scratch with agentic API. Never depend on external providers again.

---

## Executive Summary

**rbee (pronounced "are-bee") is an OpenAI-compatible AI orchestration platform that lets you build your own AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware. Never depend on external AI providers again.**

**Core Problem We Solve:**

> **"I'm building complex codebases with AI assistance (Claude, GPT-4, etc.). But what happens when the AI provider changes their models, shuts down, or changes pricing? My codebase becomes unmaintainable without AI. I've created a dependency I can't control."**

**Our Solution:**

- **Independence:** Build AI coders that run on YOUR hardware
- **Control:** Your models, your rules, never change without permission
- **Agentic API:** Task-based API with SSE streaming for building AI agents
- **llama-orch-utils:** TypeScript library for building LLM pipelines
- **Home Network Power:** Use every GPU across all your computers
- **OpenAI-compatible:** Drop-in replacement, switch anytime
- **Multi-Modal AI:** LLMs, Stable Diffusion, TTS, embeddings (powered by Candle)
- **User-Scriptable Routing:** Write Rhai scripts to control how AI tasks are routed

**Our Solution:**
A complete AI orchestration ecosystem with 4 binaries (queen-rbee, [ai-type]-[backend]-worker-rbee, rbee-keeper, rbee-hive), web UI, SDK, marketplace integration, and support for multiple AI modalities (text, image, audio, embeddings).

**Why This Matters:**

Developers are scared of building heavy, complicated codebases with AI assistance because:
- **Dependency risk:** What if the AI provider changes or disappears?
- **Maintenance nightmare:** Can't maintain AI-generated code without AI
- **Cost uncertainty:** Pricing can change overnight
- **Loss of control:** External providers control your tooling

**rbee solves this:** Your own AI infrastructure, your own models, always available.

**Current Status (Oct 2025):**
- ✅ **42/62 BDD scenarios passing** (68% complete)
- ✅ **11 shared crates already built** (audit-logging, auth-min, input-validation, secrets-management, narration-core, deadline-propagation, gpu-info, and more)
- ✅ **GDPR compliance ready** (895 lines of audit-logging docs, 32 pre-defined event types)
- ✅ Backend detection system operational (CUDA, Metal, CPU)
- ✅ Multi-backend worker support
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible API (v1 completion endpoints)
- ✅ llama-orch-utils (TypeScript library for agentic AI)
- 🚧 **30-day plan to first revenue** (detailed day-by-day execution plan)
- 🚧 Lifecycle management in progress (daemon/hive/worker commands)

## What Makes Us Unique

### 1. **Multi-Modal AI Platform (Beyond LLMs)**

**Powered by Candle** (Rust ML framework), we support:

- **Text Generation** (LLMs): Llama, Qwen, Phi, GPT-style models
- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion, Stable Diffusion 3
- **Audio Synthesis**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) workers
- **Vector Embeddings**: text-embedding-ada-002 style workers
- **Multimodal**: Vision-language models (future)

**Different AI tasks, different protocols:**
- Text: SSE streaming (token-by-token)
- Images: JSON response with base64 or binary
- Audio: Binary stream (MP3, WAV)
- Embeddings: JSON response (vector arrays)

**Why This Matters:**
- One platform for ALL your AI needs
- Unified API across modalities
- Same orchestration logic for text, images, audio
- Extensible: Add new modalities without breaking existing ones

### 2. **User-Scriptable Routing (Rhai)**

**Write custom routing logic in Rhai** (embedded scripting language):

```rhai
// Route based on task type and priority
fn route_task(task, workers) {
    if task.type == "image-gen" && task.priority == "high" {
        // Route Stable Diffusion to CUDA GPUs
        return workers.filter(|w| w.capability == "image-gen" && w.backend == "cuda").least_loaded();
    } else if task.type == "text-gen" && task.model.contains("70b") {
        // Route large LLMs to multi-GPU setups
        return workers.filter(|w| w.gpus > 1).first();
    } else {
        // Route everything else to available workers
        return workers.least_loaded();
    }
}
```

**Marketplace for Routing Scripts:**
- Share your routing strategies
- Download community scripts
- Monetize clever routing algorithms
- **Example:** "Best latency for EU customers" script

**Why This Matters:**
- No recompilation needed—update scripts at runtime
- Community-driven optimization
- Monetization opportunity for script creators

### 3. **Global GPU Marketplace (Revolutionary)**

**The Big Idea:** Connect to queen-rbees around the world who have idle GPUs available for tasks.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ YOUR PLATFORM (Marketplace)                                   │
│                                                               │
│  Customer-Facing API: api.yourplatform.com                   │
│       ↓                                                       │
│  Your queen-rbee (Marketplace Engine)                        │
│       ├─→ Home Lab A (queen-rbee + 3 GPUs) [Netherlands]    │
│       ├─→ Home Lab B (queen-rbee + 2 GPUs) [Germany]        │
│       └─→ Home Lab C (queen-rbee + 4 GPUs) [France]         │
│                                                               │
│  Customer pricing:  $100/hr (competitive market rate)        │
│  Provider payout:   $60/hr  (fair compensation)              │
│  Platform value:    $40/hr  (service, reliability, support)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Task-Based, Not Stable:**
- GPUs don't need to be always-on
- Perfect for idle capacity monetization
- Providers join/leave dynamically
- Platform matches tasks to available capacity

**SDK Makes It Easy:**
```typescript
// One line to switch from local to marketplace
const client = new Client('https://api.yourplatform.com', { apiKey: 'xxx' });

// Same API, global GPU access
const result = await client.enqueue({
  prompt: 'Generate an image of a cat',
  capability: 'image-gen',
  model: 'stable-diffusion-xl',
});
```

**Revenue Model:**
- 30-40% platform fee
- Providers monetize idle GPUs
- Customers get affordable, compliant inference
- Everyone wins

### 4. **EU-Native Compliance (GDPR)**
- Built-in audit logging and data residency enforcement
- GDPR-compliant endpoints (data export, deletion, consent tracking)
- EU-only worker filtering when compliance mode is enabled
- **Target:** B2B customers who need GDPR guarantees
- **Marketplace advantage:** Geo-verified EU-only providers

### 5. **Multi-Architecture Support**
- **NVIDIA CUDA** workers (VRAM-only policy for predictable performance)
- **Apple Metal** workers (unified memory architecture for M-series chips)
- **CPU** workers (fallback for models that don't require GPU)
- Extensible worker adapter system for future backends
- **Candle-powered:** Unified ML framework across all backends

### 6. **Test Reproducibility**
- Same model + same seed + temp=0 → Same output (for testing validation)
- Proof bundle system captures seeds, transcripts, and metadata
- Enables deterministic testing for CI/CD pipelines
- **Note:** This is a testing tool, not a product guarantee (LLMs have inherent non-determinism)

### 7. **Web UI + SDK + CLI**
- **rbee-keeper (Web UI):** Visual management interface (primary interface)
- **rbee-keeper (CLI):** Command-line interface for power users (same functionality)
- **SDK (Rust/TypeScript):** Programmatic access for applications
- **All three** use the same queen-rbee HTTP API

### 8. **Clean Intelligence Hierarchy (The Bee Metaphor) 🐝**
- **👑🐝 queen-rbee (The Brain):** Makes ALL intelligent decisions (scheduling, routing, admission)
  - SQLite registries: workers + beehives (with SSH details)
  - Rhai scripting engine for custom routing
  - Cascading shutdown coordinator
- **🍯🏠 rbee-hive (Hive Manager):** Executes commands, reports state (no policy decisions)
  - SQLite model catalog
  - Backend detection (CUDA, Metal, CPU)
  - Worker lifecycle management
- **🐝💪 [ai-type]-[backend]-worker-rbee (Worker Bees):** Load models, generate tokens
  - Examples: llm-cuda-worker-rbee, sd-cuda-worker-rbee
  - Stateless executors with isolated memory contexts
- **🧑‍🌾🐝 rbee-keeper (Keeper Interface):** Web UI + CLI for managing the entire system
  - Configuration mode: setup add-node, install, list-nodes
  - Daemon mode: start/stop/status (in progress)
  - Inference mode: infer command

```

### Critical Design Principle: Cascading Shutdown

**WHENEVER queen-rbee DIES, EVERYTHING DIES GRACEFULLY:**

```
queen-rbee dies (SIGTERM, crash, kill)
    ↓
ALL rbee-hive instances on ALL nodes die (via SSH SIGTERM)
    ↓
ALL workers on ALL nodes die (via shutdown command)
    ↓
ALL workers unload models and exit cleanly
    ↓
System is completely clean, no orphaned processes, no leaked VRAM
```

**Why This Matters:**
- No orphaned processes after tests
- No VRAM leaks
- Deterministic testing (every test starts from clean state)
- Production safety (graceful shutdown guarantees)

---

## How It Works: Complete Flow

### Development/Testing Mode (Ephemeral)

```bash
# User runs a one-off inference
rbee-keeper infer --node mac --model tinyllama --prompt "hello"
```

**What Happens:**
1. rbee-keeper spawns queen-rbee as child process (HTTP daemon on port 8080)
2. queen-rbee uses SSH to start rbee-hive on remote node (HTTP daemon on port 9200)
3. rbee-hive spawns worker-rbee (loads model into VRAM, HTTP daemon on port 8001)
4. Worker becomes ready, sends callback to rbee-hive (POST /v1/workers/ready)
5. rbee-hive notifies queen-rbee (POST /v1/orchestrator/worker-ready)
6. queen-rbee adds worker to global registry
7. queen-rbee routes inference request **directly** to worker (HTTP POST http://mac:8001/execute)
8. Worker streams tokens via SSE to queen-rbee
9. queen-rbee relays SSE stream to rbee-keeper stdout
10. User sees tokens appear in terminal
11. User presses Ctrl+C → **cascading shutdown kills everything gracefully**

**Result:** Clean environment, no leftover processes, ready for next test

### Production Mode (Persistent)

```bash
# Operator starts daemons manually (one-time setup)
queen-rbee daemon &
ssh mac "rbee-hive daemon &"
ssh workstation "rbee-hive daemon &"

# Application uses SDK (HTTP client)
curl -X POST http://queen:8080/v2/tasks \
  -d '{"prompt": "hello", "model": "tinyllama"}'
```

**What Happens:**
1. Daemons are pre-started by operator
2. Workers stay alive, reused across requests (high performance)
3. rbee-keeper is NOT used (SDK talks directly to queen-rbee HTTP API)
4. Operator manages lifecycle manually

**Result:** High performance, worker reuse, production-grade

---

## Key Features

### 1. User-Scriptable Orchestration (Rhai)

Write custom orchestration logic without recompiling:

```rhai
// Custom scheduling policy
fn schedule_job(job, workers) {
    if job.priority == "high" {
        // Route high-priority to CUDA GPUs
        return workers.filter(|w| w.backend == "cuda").least_loaded();
    } else {
        // Route batch jobs to CPU
        return workers.filter(|w| w.backend == "cpu").first();
    }
}

// Custom admission control
fn should_admit(job, queue_depth) {
    if queue_depth > 100 {
        return false; // Reject if queue too deep
    }
    return true;
}
```

### 2. Multi-Backend Support

```bash
# CUDA worker (NVIDIA GPU)
worker-rbee --backend cuda --model tinyllama.gguf --gpu 0

# Metal worker (Apple M-series)
worker-rbee --backend metal --model tinyllama.gguf

# CPU worker (fallback)
worker-rbee --backend cpu --model tinyllama.gguf
```

### 3. EU Compliance Mode (GDPR)

```bash
export LLORCH_EU_AUDIT=true
queen-rbee daemon
```

**Enables:**
- Immutable audit log (all API calls recorded)
- GDPR endpoints: `/gdpr/export`, `/gdpr/delete`, `/gdpr/consent`
- Data residency enforcement (EU-only workers)
- Retention policies (auto-delete old data)

### 4. Test Reproducibility & Proof Bundles

```bash
LLORCH_RUN_ID=test-001 rbee-keeper infer --model tinyllama --prompt "hello"
```

**Output:**
```
.proof_bundle/integration/test-001/
├── seeds.json         # Seeds used
├── transcript.ndjson  # SSE events
├── metadata.json      # Model ref, engine version, device
└── result.txt         # Final output
```

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Smart/Dumb Separation

**Design Principle:** ALL intelligence lives in one place (queen-rbee)

```
queen-rbee (THE BRAIN)
    ↓ makes decisions
    ↓ schedules jobs
    ↓ selects workers

rbee-hive (EXECUTOR)
    ↓ executes commands
    ↓ reports state

worker-rbee (EXECUTOR)
    ↓ loads model
    ↓ generates tokens
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to debug (one place for scheduling bugs)
- Easy to customize (change scripts, no recompilation)
- Easy to test (executors are deterministic)

### Process Isolation & Memory Ownership

**Design Principle:** Each worker owns its memory context

```
Process 1: worker-rbee (CUDA GPU 0)
    ↓ CUDA context 0
    ↓ VRAM allocation isolated

Process 2: worker-rbee (CUDA GPU 1)
    ↓ CUDA context 1
    ↓ VRAM allocation isolated

Process 3: rbee-hive (CPU)
    ↓ NVML read-only queries
    ↓ No VRAM allocation
```

**Benefits:**
- No memory corruption across workers
- Clean VRAM lifecycle
- Standalone testing
- Hardware-specific optimizations

---

## Deployment Examples

### Example 1: Single Developer

```bash
# Start queen-rbee
queen-rbee daemon &

# Start rbee-hive
rbee-hive daemon &

# Spawn workers on different GPUs
rbee-hive worker spawn cuda --model llama-7b --gpu 0
rbee-hive worker spawn cuda --model mistral-7b --gpu 1

# Run inference
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v2/tasks \
  -d '{"prompt": "hello", "model": "llama-7b"}'
```

### Example 2: Multi-Node Team

```bash
# On orchestrator machine:
queen-rbee daemon &

# On remote machines:
ssh mac "rbee-hive daemon &"
ssh workstation "rbee-hive daemon &"

# Spawn workers:
ssh mac "rbee-hive worker spawn metal --model llama-7b"
ssh workstation "rbee-hive worker spawn cuda --model llama-70b"

# Team uses SDK
curl -X POST http://orchestrator:8080/v2/tasks \
  -d '{"prompt": "hello", "model": "llama-70b"}'
```

### Example 3: EU Compliance

```bash
# Enable EU audit mode
export LLORCH_EU_AUDIT=true
export LLORCH_AUDIT_LOG_PATH=/var/log/llorch/audit.log

queen-rbee daemon &

# All API calls are logged
# GDPR endpoints are enabled
# Workers are filtered to EU-only
```

## The Revolutionary Marketplace Model

### The Vision: Global Task-Based GPU Network

**Traditional GPU Rentals (Runpod, Vast.ai):**
- Rent entire servers by the hour
- Pay even when idle
- Complex setup (Docker, SSH)
- No orchestration

**Our Marketplace (Task-Based):**
- Pay per task, not per hour
- No idle costs
- One-line SDK integration
- Automatic orchestration

### How It Works

**For GPU Providers (Monetize Idle Capacity):**

```bash
# 1. Run your own queen-rbee locally
queen-rbee daemon &

# 2. Register with the platform marketplace
curl -X POST https://api.yourplatform.com/v2/platform/providers/register \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": "home-lab-123",
    "endpoint": "https://my-home-lab.example.com",
    "pricing": {"per_token": 0.0008, "per_hour": 4.0},
    "capacity": {"total_gpus": 6, "total_vram_gb": 144},
    "geo": {"country": "NL", "region": "EU"}
  }'

# 3. Start earning when customers submit tasks
# Your queen-rbee receives tasks, routes to your workers, you get paid
```

**For Customers (Access Global GPU Capacity):**

```typescript
// One line to access global marketplace
const client = new Client('https://api.yourplatform.com', { apiKey: 'xxx' });

// Submit task - platform routes to best provider
const result = await client.enqueue({
  prompt: 'Generate a cat image',
  capability: 'image-gen',
  model: 'stable-diffusion-xl',
});

// You pay per task, not per hour
// Platform handles routing, billing, SLA
```

**For Platform (Create Value):**

- **Match supply with demand:** Route tasks to available providers
- **Quality assurance:** Verify hardware, monitor uptime, enforce SLAs
- **Billing integration:** Handle payments, invoicing, provider payouts
- **Compliance:** EU-only routing, GDPR audit trails
- **Margin:** 30-40% platform fee covers infrastructure, support, reliability

### Revenue Projections

**Conservative Scenario (100 Customers):**

## 🐝 The Bee Metaphor

**Why bees?** Because our architecture mirrors a real beehive:

- **👑🐝 Queen Bee** - The brain, makes all decisions
- **🍯🏠 Hive** - The home, manages resources and workers
- **🐝💪 Worker Bees** - The executors, do the actual work
- **🧑‍🌾🐝 Beekeeper** - The interface, manages the entire colony

Just like a real hive:
- Queen coordinates everything
- Hives provide structure and resources
- Workers execute tasks in parallel
- Keeper observes and manages from outside

**The result:** A harmonious, efficient, scalable system. 🍯
