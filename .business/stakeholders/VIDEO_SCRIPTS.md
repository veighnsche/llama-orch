# 🎬 Video Scripts for Different Audiences

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Project:** rbee (pronounced "are-bee")

**🎯 PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCE:** Developers who build with AI but don't want to depend on big AI providers.

**THE FEAR:** Building complex codebases with AI assistance. What if the AI provider changes, shuts down, or changes pricing? Your codebase becomes unmaintainable.

**THE SOLUTION:** rbee = your own AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware. Build AI coders from scratch with agentic API. Never depend on external providers again.
