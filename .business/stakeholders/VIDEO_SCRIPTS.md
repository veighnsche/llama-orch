**Script:**
```
rbee (pronounced "are-bee"): GPU marketplace like Airbnb for AI. PRIMARY USE CASE: Power Zed IDE's AI agents with your homelab GPUs via OpenAI-compatible API. Task-based pricing disrupts hourly rentals. Platform mode: built-in Rhai scheduler for multi-tenant fairness. Home/Lab mode: custom Rhai scripts for your routing logic. 30-40% platform margins. $6M/year revenue potential with 50 enterprise customers. Network effects: more GPU providers attract more customers, which attracts more providers. Open source (GPL-3.0) with commercial marketplace. EU-compliant from day 1. Multi-modal: LLMs, Stable Diffusion, TTS, embeddings—all unified. 🐝🍯
```

Multi-backend support: CUDA, Metal, CPU—automatic detection. GDPR-native with 7-year audit retention, immutable logs, tamper detection. User-scriptable routing via Rhai scheduler. BDD-tested with 31/62 scenarios passing (50% complete). SSH-based control for homelab and enterprise. Self-hosted for full control or marketplace for scale. Production-ready with cascading shutdown, health monitoring, idle timeout. 🐝

## 3. 👨‍💻 Software Developers

**Focus:** Rhai scripting, technical capabilities, API

**Script:**
```
rbee (pronounced "are-bee"): OpenAI-compatible API means drop-in replacement for any AI coding tool. Power Zed IDE's AI agents with YOUR homelab GPUs. Write custom Rhai schedulers in Home/Lab mode—40+ helper functions for worker selection, GPU queries, quota checks, eviction policies. Platform mode uses immutable built-in scheduler for marketplace. Multi-modal unified API: LLMs, Stable Diffusion, TTS, embeddings. Candle-powered (Rust ML framework). TypeScript and Rust SDKs. SSE streaming for real-time tokens. One SDK, one API, multiple modalities. Open source (GPL-3.0). Zero recompilation needed—update Rhai scripts live. 🐝💪
```

## 4. 🏠 Homelab Enthusiasts / Self-Hosters

**Focus:** Control, privacy, ease of use

**Script:**
```
rbee (pronounced "are-bee"): THE MAIN GOAL is to power Zed IDE's AI agents with YOUR homelab GPUs. OpenAI-compatible API = drop-in replacement. Run AI coding on YOUR hardware. Zero cloud dependencies. Zero API costs. SSH-based control (homelab-friendly). Pick which GPU runs which model, even across remote computers in your network. Multi-backend: CUDA for NVIDIA, Metal for Apple Silicon, CPU fallback. Web UI for visual management + CLI for power users. Model catalog with auto-download from HuggingFace. Idle timeout automatically frees VRAM after 5 minutes. Cascading shutdown prevents orphaned processes. Complete control, complete privacy. Use ALL your computers' GPU power for AI coding. 🐝🏠
```

## 5. 💰 Angel Investors / VCs

**Focus:** Market opportunity, traction, revenue model

**Script:**
```
Task-based GPU marketplace disrupting $10B+ hourly rental market (Vast.ai, Runpod). 30-40% platform margins. $6M/year revenue potential with just 50 enterprise customers at $10K/month. Network effects: more GPU providers → more capacity → more customers → more providers. EU-compliance is competitive moat (GDPR-native). 50% complete (31/62 BDD tests passing). Open source community (GPL-3.0) drives adoption. Proven AI development methodology (99% AI-generated code). Perfect timing: AI boom + GPU shortage. Fundable with clear path to profitability. 🚀💰
```

## 6. 🔬 AI Researchers / ML Engineers

**Focus:** Multi-modal support, reproducibility, testing

**Script:**
```
Multi-modal AI platform: LLMs, Stable Diffusion, TTS, embeddings—unified API. Candle-powered (Rust ML framework, HuggingFace). Proof bundles for reproducibility: same seed → same output, every time. BDD-tested with executable specs. Backend auto-detection: CUDA, Metal, CPU. User-scriptable routing via Rhai. Test reproducibility for CI/CD pipelines. Property tests for invariants. Determinism suite for regression testing. Research-grade quality with production-ready infrastructure. 🐝🔬
```

## 7. 🌍 EU Businesses / Compliance Officers

**Focus:** GDPR, data residency, compliance

**Script:**
```
EU-native AI platform. GDPR-compliant by design: immutable audit logging (7-year retention), data residency controls, consent tracking, right to erasure. EU-only worker filtering via geo-verification. No US cloud dependencies. Self-hosted for maximum control or marketplace with EU providers. Built-in compliance endpoints: data export, data deletion, consent management, audit trail access. SOC2 and ISO 27001 aligned. Tamper-evident logs with blockchain-style hash chains. B2B ready with enterprise SLAs. 🇪🇺🔒
