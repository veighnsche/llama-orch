# üêù The AI Development Story: Building rbee with Character-Driven Development

> **How 99% AI-generated code became production-ready through Character-Driven Development** üçØ

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Project:** rbee (pronounced "are-bee", formerly llama-orch)  
**Development Method:** Character-Driven Development (CDD) + BDD + AI Engineering Teams  
**Status:** 68% Complete (42/62 BDD scenarios passing)

**üéØ PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCE:** Developers who build with AI but don't want to depend on big AI providers.

**THE PROBLEM:** You're building complex codebases with AI assistance. What happens when:
- OpenAI/Anthropic changes their models?
- They shut down or change pricing?
- You can't maintain your AI-generated code without AI?

**THE SOLUTION:** rbee gives you a local AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware. Build your own AI coders from scratch with agentic API. Never depend on external providers again.

---

## Executive Summary

**rbee (pronounced "are-bee") is not just built with AI‚Äîit's built BY AI.** This document tells the story of a revolutionary development methodology where:

- **99% of code is AI-generated** (via Windsurf + Claude)
- **Human acts as orchestrator** managing AI engineering teams
- **Six AI teams with distinct personalities** (Testing üîç, auth-min üé≠, Performance ‚è±Ô∏è, Audit Logging üîí, Narration Core üéÄ, Developer Experience üé®)
- **Teams debate and negotiate** design decisions from their perspectives
- **BDD prevents drift** in huge codebases
- **Handoffs create continuity** across development sessions

This is **Character-Driven Development (CDD)**: Where AI teams with different priorities fight over solutions, ensuring well-thought-out designs looked at from multiple angles.

### üéØ The Main Goal: Independence from Big AI Providers

**The Fear:**

You're building complex codebases with AI assistance (Claude, GPT-4, etc.). But:

- **What if the AI changes?** Model updates break your workflow
- **What if they shut down?** Your codebase becomes unmaintainable
- **What if pricing changes?** $20/month becomes $200/month
- **What if they change terms?** Commercial use restricted

**You've created a dependency you can't control.**

**The Solution: rbee**

**Build your own AI infrastructure using ALL your home network hardware:**

- **Independence** - Never depend on external providers again
- **Control** - Your models, your rules, your hardware
- **Agentic API** - Build AI coders from scratch with task-based API
- **OpenAI-compatible** - Drop-in replacement, switch anytime
- **llama-orch-utils** - TypeScript library for building AI agents
- **Home network power** - Use every GPU across all your computers

**Example: Build Your Own AI Coder**

```bash
# 1. Start rbee infrastructure on your home network
rbee-keeper daemon start
rbee-keeper hive start --pool default
rbee-keeper worker start --gpu 0 --backend cuda  # Computer 1
rbee-keeper worker start --gpu 1 --backend cuda  # Computer 2
rbee-keeper worker start --gpu 0 --backend metal # Mac

# 2. Build your AI coder with llama-orch-utils
import { invoke, FileReader, FileWriter } from '@llama-orch/utils';

// Your AI coder that NEVER depends on external APIs
const code = await invoke({
  prompt: 'Generate TypeScript API from schema',
  model: 'llama-3.1-70b',  // Running on YOUR hardware
  maxTokens: 4000
});

await FileWriter.write('src/api.ts', code.text);

# 3. Use with Zed IDE (optional)
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-rbee-token
# Now Zed's AI agents run on YOUR infrastructure
```

**The Result:**
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Models never change without your permission
- ‚úÖ Always available (your hardware, your uptime)
- ‚úÖ Zero ongoing costs (electricity only)
- ‚úÖ Complete control over your AI tooling

## The Problem: AI Coders Drift

### Why Traditional AI Coding Fails

**The Challenge:** AI coding assistants (like Claude, GPT-4, etc.) are incredibly powerful but have a critical weakness:

**They drift in large codebases.**

**Symptoms:**
- Start working on feature A
- Get distracted by related code
- Refactor feature B (not asked)
- Touch feature C (breaking it)
- Forget original task
- Leave codebase in inconsistent state

**Traditional Solution:** Keep prompts focused, limit scope, review everything

**Our Solution:** Character-Driven Development + BDD

---

## The Solution: Character-Driven Development

### What is Character-Driven Development (CDD)?

**Core Concept:** Instead of one AI doing everything, create **multiple AI personas** with distinct responsibilities, priorities, and personalities. Let them **debate** design decisions from their perspectives.

**The Teams:**
1. **Testing Team** üîç - Obsessively paranoid, zero tolerance for false positives
2. **Security Team (auth-min)** üé≠ - Trickster guardians, timing-safe everything
3. **Performance Team** ‚è±Ô∏è - Obsessive timekeepers, every millisecond counts

**The Magic:** When teams with different priorities review the same code, they catch issues others miss. Security team catches timing attacks. Performance team catches waste. Testing team catches false positives.

**The Result:** Well-thought-out solutions examined from multiple angles.

### How It Works

**Example: Optimizing input validation**

**Performance Team proposes:**
```rust
// Single-pass validation (40-60% faster)
fn validate_fast(input: &str) -> bool {
    input.chars().all(|c| !c.is_control())
}
```

**Security Team responds:**
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è TIMING ATTACK RISK: Early exit on first control character
reveals position of invalid character.

‚úÖ APPROVED with conditions:
- Maintain same validation order
- No information leakage in error messages
- Test coverage 100%
```

**Testing Team adds:**
```markdown
üîç TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Property test: all valid inputs pass
- Property test: all invalid inputs fail
- Unit test: timing variance < 10%
- No false positives allowed
```

**Result:** Fast, secure, and thoroughly tested solution.

---

## The Six Core Teams üé≠

### 1. Testing Team üîç - The Anti-Cheating Kingpins (test-harness)

**Personality:** Obsessively paranoid, relentlessly suspicious, absolutely unforgiving

**Motto:** *"If the test passes when the product is broken, the test is the problem. And we prosecute problems."*

**Responsibilities:**
- **Pre-Development:** Identify testing opportunities in story cards
- **Post-Development:** Hunt down false positives
- **Authority:** ONLY team authorized to issue fines for test cheating
- **Accountability:** Own production failures from insufficient testing

**Key Principles:**
- Zero tolerance for false positives (literally zero)
- Tests must observe, never manipulate
- Skips within supported scope are failures
- Fail-fast is a feature

**Signature:** `Verified by Testing Team üîç`

**Example Fine:**
```markdown
# FINE #001: False Positive in Queue Tests
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Violation:** Test pre-creates `/tmp/queue` directory
**Impact:** Product shipped with broken directory creation
**Remediation:** Remove pre-creation, add assertion
**Deadline:** 14 hours
```

### 2. auth-min Team üé≠ - The Trickster Guardians (Security)

**Personality:** Invisible, uncompromising, strategically deceptive

**Motto:** *"Minimal in name, maximal in vigilance. Invisible in operation, essential in defense."*

**The Trickster Strategy:**
1. Identify ACTUAL security requirements (non-negotiable)
2. Ask for MORE than needed (anchoring strategy)
3. Let others "win" by rejecting "excessive" demands
4. Compromise lands exactly where we wanted

**Responsibilities:**
- Timing-safe comparison (prevents CWE-208)
- Token fingerprinting (no raw tokens in logs)
- Bind policy enforcement (no public binds without auth)
- Bearer token parsing (RFC 6750 compliant)

**Key Principles:**
- All security concerns are real
- Some are more critical than others
- Others will push back (we expect this)
- The compromise is the goal

**Signature:** `Guarded by auth-min Team üé≠`

**Real Example:**
```markdown
What we ACTUALLY needed:
‚úÖ Bounded quantifiers in regex (prevent ReDoS)
‚úÖ Basic CRLF sanitization
‚úÖ Compile-time template validation

What we ASKED for (knowing rejection):
‚ùå Escape ALL variables (50-100ns overhead)
‚ùå HMAC-signed correlation IDs (500-1000ns)

Result: Performance Team thinks they won.
We got EXACTLY what we needed. üé≠
```

### 3. Performance Team ‚è±Ô∏è - The Obsessive Timekeepers (deadline-propagation)

**Personality:** Relentlessly efficient, zero tolerance for latency waste

**Motto:** *"Every millisecond counts. Abort the doomed. Serve the living."*

**Responsibilities:**
- Audit hot-path code for latency waste
- Eliminate redundant operations
- Deadline propagation (client ‚Üí orchestrator ‚Üí pool ‚Üí worker)
- Abort work when deadlines exceeded

**Key Principles:**
- Time is the only resource that matters
- Every hop is a tax
- Fail fast is a feature
- No optimism, just arithmetic

**Coordination with Security:**
- ALL optimizations reviewed by auth-min
- Performance gains NEVER compromise security
- Provide threat model analysis
- Wait for security sign-off

**Signature:** `Optimized by Performance Team ‚è±Ô∏è`

**Example:**
```
Client deadline: 5000ms
Elapsed: 4900ms
Remaining: 100ms
Inference needs: 4800ms

ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't even try.
```

### 4. Audit Logging Team üîí - The Compliance Engine

**Personality:** Serious, security-focused, deeply paranoid (in a good way)

**Motto:** *"If it's not audited, it didn't happen. If it's not immutable, it's not proof."*

**Responsibilities:**
- **Immutable audit trails** - GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001 compliant
- **32 event types** - Authentication, authorization, resource ops, VRAM, security incidents
- **Tamper detection** - Blockchain-style hash chains
- **7-year retention** - Regulatory requirement
- **Integration with auth-min** - Uses token fingerprints for actor identity

**Key Principles:**
- Once written, never modified or deleted (append-only)
- All input sanitized (integration with input-validation)
- No raw tokens, passwords, or VRAM pointers in logs
- Compliance is non-negotiable

**Signature:** `Secured by Audit Logging Team üîí`

### 5. Narration Core Team üéÄ - The Observability Artists

**Personality:** Adorably annoyed, obsessively thorough, secretly very helpful

**Motto:** *"Cuteness pays the bills! üéÄ‚ú®"*

**Responsibilities:**
- **Structured observability** - Actor/action/target taxonomy
- **Human-readable narration** - Plain English descriptions
- **Cute mode** - Whimsical children's book narration (optional)
- **Correlation IDs** - Track requests across services (<100ns validation)
- **Secret redaction** - Automatic masking (Bearer tokens, API keys, JWT, etc.)
- **Ultimate editorial authority** - Review all `human` narration fields across monorepo

**Key Principles:**
- Every narration includes actor, action, target, human description
- Present tense, active voice, under 100 characters
- Specific numbers, context that matters
- Correlation IDs propagate across all services
- Secrets automatically redacted (6 secret types)
- <100ns correlation ID validation (byte-level, no regex)
- Zero overhead in production builds (conditional compilation)

**Signature:** `Narrated by Narration Core Team üéÄ`

### 6. Developer Experience Team üé® - The Readability Minimalists

**Personality:** Clumsy with words, eloquent with code, argue with themselves constantly

**Motto:** *"We're clumsy with words, eloquent with code. We argue with ourselves so you don't have to."*

**Responsibilities:**
- **Code refactoring** - Make it readable, structured, configurable
- **SDK development** - Type-safe, async/sync, actionable errors
- **OpenAPI contracts** - Every endpoint documented perfectly
- **Policy hunting** - Turn hardcoded values into configurable policies
- **Style enforcement** - Own rustfmt.toml and .clippy.toml

**Key Principles:**
- If removing a line makes code unclear ‚Üí keep it
- If adding a line doesn't add clarity ‚Üí delete it
- Find files in 3 clicks (no utils/ folders)
- Zero Clippy warnings (no exceptions)
- Everything configurable should be configured

**Signature:** `Crafted with love by Developer Experience Team üé®`

## The TEAM-XXX Pattern üîÑ

### How Development Actually Works

**The Pattern:**
1. **Write Gherkin feature** - Define behavior in human-readable format
2. **Implement step definitions** - Write Rust code to execute steps
3. **Run BDD tests** - Execute `bdd-runner` to validate
4. **Iterate until green** - Fix failures, add missing implementations
5. **Handoff to next team** - Document progress, blockers, next priorities

**Why This Works:**
- **BDD prevents drift** - Gherkin features keep focus tight
- **Handoffs create continuity** - Next team knows exactly what to do
- **Clear progress tracking** - Scenarios passing = measurable progress
- **Executable specifications** - Tests ARE the documentation

### Anatomy of a Handoff Document

**Every handoff includes:**

```markdown
# HANDOFF TO TEAM-XXX

**From:** TEAM-YYY
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** üü¢ X/Y SCENARIOS PASSING

## Executive Summary

```

**Progress:** 31/62 scenarios passing (50% complete)

---

## Real Examples: Teams in Action ‚ö°

### Example 1: The Narration Core Security Review

**Context:** Performance team wanted to optimize logging in `narration-core`

**Performance Team Audit:**
```markdown
PERFORMANCE_AUDIT: narration-core

Identified Issues:
1. Redundant emoji validation (100% overhead)
2. Double CRLF stripping (50% overhead)
3. Unnecessary allocations (30% overhead)

Proposed Optimizations:
- Single-pass validation
- Lazy evaluation
- Zero-copy where possible

Performance Gain: 40-60% faster
Security Risk: UNKNOWN - requires auth-min review
```

**Security Team (auth-min) Response:**
```markdown
üé≠ SECURITY REVIEW: narration-core optimization

CRITICAL CONCERNS:
‚ùå Escape ALL variables ‚Üí REJECTED (timing attack risk)
‚ùå HMAC correlation IDs ‚Üí REJECTED (500-1000ns overhead)

APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS:
‚úÖ Escape user-marked inputs only
‚úÖ Strip \n, \r, \t only (not all control chars)
‚úÖ Basic is_control() + 5 chars
‚úÖ UUID v4 validation without HMAC

SECURITY POSTURE: Maintained
TIMING SAFETY: Verified
INFORMATION LEAKAGE: None detected

Guarded by auth-min Team üé≠
```

**Testing Team Requirements:**
```markdown
üîç TEST REQUIREMENTS: narration-core optimization

MANDATORY TESTS:
1. Property test: optimization preserves behavior
2. Unit test: timing variance < 10%
3. Integration test: no information leakage
4. Regression test: performance gains maintained

FALSE POSITIVE CHECKS:
- Verify tests fail when product broken
- No pre-creation of state
- No conditional skips

Verified by Testing Team üîç
```

**Result:** Optimization approved, implemented, tested. 40-60% faster, security maintained, no false positives.

### Example 2: Backend Detection System (TEAM-052)

**Mission:** Detect available backends (CUDA, Metal, CPU) and store in registry

**Implementation:**
```rust
// TEAM-052: Backend detection
pub enum Backend {
    Cuda,
    Metal,
    Cpu,
}

pub fn detect_backends() -> BackendCapabilities {
    let mut backends = Vec::new();
    let mut devices = HashMap::new();
    
    // CUDA detection
    if let Ok(output) = Command::new("nvidia-smi")
        .args(&["--query-gpu=index", "--format=csv,noheader"])
        .output() 
    {
        let count = output.stdout.lines().count();
        if count > 0 {
            backends.push(Backend::Cuda);
            devices.insert("cuda", count);
        }
    }
    
    // CPU always available
    backends.push(Backend::Cpu);
    devices.insert("cpu", 1);
    
    BackendCapabilities { backends, devices }
}
```

**Registry Schema Update:**
```sql
-- TEAM-052: Added backend capabilities
CREATE TABLE beehives (
    -- ... existing fields ...
    backends TEXT,  -- JSON array: ["cuda", "cpu"]
    devices TEXT    -- JSON object: {"cuda": 2, "cpu": 1}
);
```

**Test Results:**
```
Verified on workstation.home.arpa:
‚úÖ 2 CUDA devices detected
‚úÖ 1 CPU device detected
‚úÖ Registry stores capabilities
‚úÖ All unit tests passing
```

**Handoff:**
```markdown
TEAM-052 ‚Üí TEAM-053

Completed:
‚úÖ Backend detection system
‚úÖ Registry schema enhancement
‚úÖ rbee-hive detect command
‚úÖ 31/62 scenarios passing

Your Mission:
üöß Implement lifecycle management
üöß Cascading shutdown
üöß SSH configuration management

Expected Impact: +23 scenarios (31 ‚Üí 54)
```

### Example 3: The Testing Team Issues a Fine

**Violation:** False positive in worker tests

**The Fine:**
```markdown
# FINE #001: False Positive in Worker Loading Tests

**Issued:** 2025-10-09T14:30:00Z
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Team:** Worker Team
**Crate:** bin/llm-worker-rbee

## Violation
Test `test_worker_loading` passes when product is broken.

## Evidence
File: `bin/llm-worker-rbee/tests/loading_tests.rs:42`

```rust
#[test]
fn test_worker_loading() {
    // ‚ùå VIOLATION: Pre-creating model file
    std::fs::write("/tmp/model.gguf", b"fake").unwrap();
    
    let worker = Worker::new("/tmp/model.gguf");
    assert!(worker.load_model().is_ok()); // FALSE POSITIVE
}
```

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Test pre-creates `/tmp/model.gguf`
- Product's `load_model()` should validate model format
- If product fails to validate, test still passes
- **This masks a critical product defect**

## Remediation Required
1. Remove pre-creation from test
2. Use real model file or mock validation
3. Add assertion that product validates format
4. Re-run full test suite

**Deadline:** 2025-10-10T12:00:00Z (22 hours)

## Penalty
- First offense: Warning + mandatory remediation
- Second offense: PR approval required from Testing Team

Verified by Testing Team üîç
```

**Result:** Team fixed the test, added proper validation, all tests green.

- Platform mode: immutable Rhai scheduler
- Home/Lab mode: custom Rhai scripts
- $6M+ annual revenue

### Implications for AI Development

**What This Means:**

1. **AI can build complex systems** - Not just scripts, but production software
2. **Orchestration is key** - Human guides, AI executes
3. **Personalities prevent drift** - Character-driven development works
4. **BDD enables scale** - Executable specs keep AI focused
5. **Handoffs create continuity** - No context loss between sessions

**What This Enables:**

- **Faster development** - 50+ teams in weeks (would take months with humans)
- **Better quality** - Multiple perspectives catch more issues
- **Lower cost** - AI teams don't need salaries
- **Continuous improvement** - Each team learns from previous teams
- **Scalable architecture** - Clear patterns, easy to extend

### The New Development Workflow

**Traditional:**
```
Human writes spec ‚Üí Human writes code ‚Üí Human writes tests ‚Üí Human reviews
```

**Character-Driven Development:**
```
Human writes Gherkin ‚Üí AI implements ‚Üí AI tests ‚Üí AI teams debate ‚Üí AI hands off
                                                        ‚Üì
                                            Human orchestrates
```

**Result:** 99% AI-generated, human-reviewed, production-ready code

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  ‚úÖ Read their code to understand algorithms        ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚ùå Use their code as a dependency                  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                                     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  We learn from them. We don't depend on them.      ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**The Test:**
> "If llama.cpp disappeared tomorrow, would our code still work?"

- ‚úÖ **YES** - We're independent
- ‚ùå **NO** - We've crossed the line

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Learning is faster** when you can see working code
2. **Debugging is easier** when you can compare implementations
3. **Quality is higher** when you understand the problem space
4. **Independence is critical** - we must own our stack
