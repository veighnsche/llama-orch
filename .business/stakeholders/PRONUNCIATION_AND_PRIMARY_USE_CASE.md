## Pronunciation

**rbee** is pronounced **"are-bee"** (like the letters R-B)

‚ùå NOT "erbee"  
‚ùå NOT "rubee"  
‚úÖ **"are-bee"** (R-B)

---

## Primary Use Case

### üéØ THE MAIN GOAL

**Power Zed IDE's AI agents with your homelab GPUs**

rbee provides an **OpenAI-compatible API** that lets you use **ALL your computers' GPU power** for AI coding instead of paying for cloud APIs.

### How It Works

```bash
# 1. Start rbee on your homelab
rbee-keeper daemon start
rbee-keeper hive start --pool default
rbee-keeper worker start --gpu 0 --backend cuda

# 2. Configure Zed IDE to use rbee instead of OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-rbee-token

# 3. Now Zed's AI agents run on YOUR GPUs!
# Zero API costs. Full control. Use ALL your computers' GPU power.
```

### Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Zero API costs** - Your hardware, your control
- ‚úÖ **Full privacy** - Code never leaves your network
- ‚úÖ **Use all your GPUs** - Across multiple computers
- ‚úÖ **Drop-in replacement** - OpenAI-compatible API
- ‚úÖ **Multi-backend** - CUDA, Metal, CPU

### Compatible Tools

rbee's OpenAI-compatible API works with:
- **Zed IDE** (AI agents)
- **Cursor IDE**
- **Continue.dev**
- **Any tool using OpenAI SDK**
