### Option B: Rebrand Binaries
- Product: **[NAME]**
- Daemon 1: **[name]d** (orchestrator)
- Daemon 2: **[name]-worker** (worker)
- CLI 1: **[name]** (remote control)
- CLI 2: **[name]-pool** (local pool)

### Option C: Hybrid
- Product: **[NAME]**
- Keep technical names for binaries
- Use product name for marketing only

**Your choice:** ___________

## Examples from Similar Products

**For inspiration:**

| Product | Name Origin | Tagline |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Kubernetes | Greek: "helmsman" | Production-Grade Container Orchestration |
| Docker | Dock worker | Build, Ship, Run |
| Terraform | Latin: "earth shaper" | Infrastructure as Code |
| Ansible | Sci-fi: instant communication | Automation for Everyone |

## Final Thoughts

**Remember:**
- A great name is memorable, easy to say, and hints at what you do
- Don't overthink it - you can always rebrand later (but it's painful)
- Test it with real users/developers
- Make sure it's not already taken (trademark search!)
- The name matters less than the product quality

**Good luck! 🚀**
