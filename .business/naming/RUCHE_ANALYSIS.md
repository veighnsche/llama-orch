## üí≠ Personal Opinion (AI Analysis)

Ruche is a **bold, sophisticated choice** that could work brilliantly for a European-focused company. The pronunciation barrier is real but manageable with proper brand education. 

**The key question:** Are you willing to invest in teaching people how to say your product name? If yes, Ruche is beautiful. If no, Hyve is safer.

**For YOUR vision** (developers, startups, private/self-hosted, EU-based):
- ‚úÖ **European market:** Perfect fit
- ‚úÖ **Developer audience:** Sophisticated enough to appreciate it
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **US expansion:** Will face challenges
- ‚úÖ **Brand differentiation:** Stands out completely

**My take:** Ruche is the **high-risk, high-reward** choice. Hyve is the **safe, smart** choice. ComputeHive is the **clear, boring** choice.

---

**Score: 8.65/10** (excellent but risky)

**Recommendation:** Use Ruche if Europe-first, Hyve if global-first.
