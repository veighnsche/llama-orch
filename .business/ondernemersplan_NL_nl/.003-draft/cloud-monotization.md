# Draft Notes — OSS Core + Cloud Monetization

## Core Idea

You build **three open-source projects**, each with SDKs, each usable at home — and then monetize by offering **managed cloud versions** where integration, scale, and compliance are turnkey.

---

## The Three OSS Projects

1. **llama-orch (orchestrator)**

   * Multi-GPU orchestration engine (GPL).
   * Reads a blueprint spec → generates and runs an AI app.
   * SDKs let developers integrate blueprints into workflows.
   * **Value prop**: no vendor lock-in, no token billing, EU-friendly self-host.
   * **Cloud monetization**: production-ready **Agentic API** (autoscaling GPUs, SLA, logs).

2. **AI CRM (growth module)**

   * Spec-driven CRM with AI-native surfaces: summaries, lead scoring, next-step suggestions.
   * SDK: create contacts, leads, and interactions in-app.
   * Runs locally for free, integrates seamlessly with orchestrator + email.
   * **Cloud monetization**: hosted **CRM SaaS** with analytics, dashboards, integrations, compliance packs.

3. **AI SMTP Server (support module)**

   * Open-source mail server with AI classification (spam, phishing, summaries, routing).
   * SDK: receive inbound mail as structured events (intent, summary, priority).
   * Self-hostable, EU-friendly.
   * **Cloud monetization**: **Managed Email Cloud** → guaranteed deliverability, scaling, compliance (e.g. PII redaction, EU data routing).

## The Play (User Journey)

0. **Discover** llama-orch → “I can write a blueprint and generate an app locally, without token bills.”
1. **Build** app with SDK + orchestrator → instant MVP.
2. **Launch** app → needs marketing & support. Plug in **CRM** and **SMTP** SDKs (already integrated).
3. **Scale** → upgrade to **Agentic API**, **CRM Cloud**, **Email Cloud** for production reliability, analytics, and compliance.

## Strategic Levers

* **Adoption**: OSS projects + SDKs lower entry barrier.
* **Lock-in**: once you build with SDKs, it’s easiest to stay in the ecosystem.
* **Margins**: come from running shared infra (multi-tenant) + managing complexity for users.
* **EU-friendly wedge**: open-source, proof-first, transparent hosting in the Netherlands.

## Positioning

> **“Firebase for AI startups, but post-launch.”**
> From blueprint to app to CRM + support, all AI-native, all open-source. Free to self-host, or upgrade to our integrated cloud.
