# Sales Pitch (CTO / Technical Assessment)

## Headline

**Open, auditable AI infrastructure — managed APIs with a curated toolkit**

## Short Pitch

I provide a **Public Tap API** for quick starts and a **Private Tap API** on dedicated GPUs.
Both are built on open-source orchestration with **proof-first operations** — logs, metrics, and documentation included.
Your team also gets a **toolkit** (SDK + deterministic applets) to build and control AI tools without black-box dependencies.

## Why it matters for a CTO

Technical leaders hesitate to adopt AI because:

* Proprietary APIs mean **vendor lock-in** and no portability.
* Cloud billing is **opaque**; budgets are unpredictable.
* Compliance requires **logs, metrics, and documentation** that most providers don’t supply.
* Many open-source tools are unstable or poorly maintained.

My offer addresses all of these:

* **Standards-based APIs** (native + OpenAI-compatible) → easy integration.
* **Open-source orchestration core** → no hidden engine logic, inspectable.
* **Proof-driven deployment** → reproducible runs with metrics, logs, and SSE transcripts.
* **Prepaid model** → predictable costs and easy budget approval.
* **Curated OSS models & applets** → stable, production-ready starting set.

## What you get

### 1. Public Tap — shared agentic API

* Prepaid credits, instant access.
* Works with my SDK or any OpenAI-compatible client.
* Ideal for trials, pilots, and low-volume workloads.

### 2. Private Tap — dedicated GPUs

* Your own managed API endpoint.
* Scales from 1× to 8× GPUs.
* Deployed with one-click DevOps scripts; fully monitored and maintained.
* Meets privacy, performance, and compliance needs.

### 3. Toolkit — SDK + deterministic applets

* For TypeScript, JavaScript, and Rust (Python/Mojo coming soon).
* Prebuilt applets for code review, summarization, document QA, and automation.
* Deterministic execution ensures reproducibility and control.
* Your team can extend or build new applets on top.

---

## Differentiation (technical)

* **Determinism guarantees** → identical runs under identical inputs.
* **Observability built-in** → Prometheus metrics, logs, dashboards, SSE frames.
* **EU data residency & governance** → aligned with EU AI Act expectations.
* **Independent but standards-aligned** → integrates into your stack without forcing my stack on you.

## One-liner

**“I deliver open, auditable AI APIs that your engineers can trust — with the proofs, metrics, and tools to integrate them into production.”**
