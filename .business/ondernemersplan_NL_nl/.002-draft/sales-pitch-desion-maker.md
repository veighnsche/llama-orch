# Sales Pitch (Decision-Maker Version)

## Headline

**Private & Public AI APIs — simple, compliant, and cost-predictable**

## Short Pitch

I help companies adopt AI without the usual risks.
You can start small with a **Public API** on prepaid credits, then scale up to your own **Private API** on dedicated GPUs.
Everything is transparent, EU-based, and comes with the proofs and documentation your business needs.

## Why it matters

Leaders want AI in production, but face recurring problems:

* **Risk of fines or non-compliance** — US platforms rarely meet EU documentation or residency standards.
* **Hidden costs** — pay-as-you-go billing surprises kill budgets.
* **Lack of control** — black-box systems create dependency and lock-in.

My solution solves these with:

* **Predictable costs** (prepaid, no surprise bills)
* **EU-based infrastructure** (data stays in Europe)
* **Proof-first operations** (auditable logs and metrics)

## What you get

### Public Tap — for fast starts

* Prepaid credits (e.g. €50, €200, €500 packs)
* Start testing in minutes
* Best for demos, pilots, or client showcases

### Private Tap — for scale and compliance

* Your own dedicated AI endpoint on GPUs
* Fully managed: monitoring, upgrades, logs, documentation
* Best for regulated, privacy-sensitive, or performance-critical work

### Toolkit — for your IT team

* Curated open-source AI tools that work out of the box
* Examples: code review, summarization, document Q\&A
* Your team stays in control — no dependency on external platforms

---

## Differentiation

* **Transparent & auditable** → Logs and documentation included
* **EU-based & compliant** → Meets data residency and governance needs
* **Predictable pricing** → Prepaid credits, GPU-hour packs, no hidden bills
* **Independent & personal** → Direct accountability, not a faceless hyperscaler

## One-liner

**“I give your company reliable, EU-ready AI at predictable costs — without black-box risks or lock-in.”**
