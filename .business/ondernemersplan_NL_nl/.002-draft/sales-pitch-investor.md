# Sales Pitch (Investor Version)

## Headline

**Public & Private AI Taps — with a curated toolkit for fast adoption**

## Short Pitch

I run a simple, transparent AI infrastructure business.
Customers can start quickly on a **Public Tap API** with prepaid credits, upgrade to a **Private Tap API** on dedicated GPUs, and extend with a **Toolkit** of curated open-source AI tools.
This model combines predictable revenue with scalable upsell potential.

## Why it matters

Companies want AI in production, but they face common barriers:

* **Tools are scattered** — too many half-finished projects on GitHub.
* **Compliance is complex** — EU rules demand documentation and logs.
* **Black-box platforms** lock customers into US providers.

My solution: a **curated, EU-based alternative**. Customers get stable tools, managed APIs, and proof that everything works.

## What I offer

### 1. Public Tap (Shared API)

* Prepaid credits, no surprise billing.
* Start in minutes, ideal for demos and pilots.
* Works with SDK and OpenAI-compatible adapter.

### 2. Private Tap (Dedicated API)

* Customer’s own endpoint on rented GPUs.
* Fully managed by me: deployment, monitoring, upgrades.
* Best for privacy, performance, and compliance.

### 3. Toolkit (Curated Open-Source AI Tools)

* Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust (Python/Mojo coming).
* Deterministic applets IT teams can trust.
* Includes helpers like code review, summarization, document QA, and internal chatbots.
* Customers control the tools; I provide the infrastructure.

---

## Differentiation

* **Proof-driven** — logs, metrics, and documentation with every deployment.
* **Open source core** — transparent, inspectable, no lock-in.
* **EU-based** — data residency and compliance built-in.
* **Independent** — not hyperscale, but personal and accountable.
* **Prepaid simplicity** — easy entry with credits; scalable with GPU-hour packs.

---

## Revenue Model

* Public Tap: prepaid credits (recurring entry-level revenue).
* Private Tap: GPU-hour packs with base management fees (scalable contracts).
* Toolkit: included for adoption, expandable to custom services.

## One-liner

**“I curate the tools and provide the taps. Customers build what they need — and I make sure it runs.”**
