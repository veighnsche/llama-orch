# Sales Pitch (Agencies & Consultancies)

## Headline

**Deliver AI demos and client solutions — faster, safer, and without lock-in**

## Short Pitch

I give agencies a simple way to prototype and deliver AI for their clients.
You can start on a **Public Tap API** with prepaid credits for demos, and then upgrade clients to a **Private API** for production.
Alongside this, I provide a **toolkit of open-source AI tools** so your team can build reliable, repeatable solutions instead of custom hacks.

## Why it matters for agencies

Agencies face specific challenges:

* **Unpredictable costs** when demos eat into monthly bills.
* **Client lock-in risk** if you build on closed US platforms.
* **Pressure to deliver fast** without losing control of quality.

My approach solves this:

* **Prepaid credits** → no surprise billing for demos.
* **EU-based, open source infra** → compliance and transparency for client confidence.
* **Upgrade path** → start with shared API, scale into dedicated Private APIs as clients commit.
* **Toolkit included** → reusable applets (summarizer, code review, doc QA) so you don’t reinvent the wheel.

## What you get

* **Fast prototyping** → plug into my SDK or OpenAI adapter, show results in hours.
* **Client-ready production** → Private Tap with monitoring, logs, and EU compliance built in.
* **Reusable toolkit** → deterministic applets and curated OSS models for repeatable solutions.
* **Proof-first reporting** → every deployment comes with logs and metrics you can show clients.

## Differentiation

* **Predictable demo costs** → prepaid credits, not runaway usage.
* **EU-local and transparent** → no awkward compliance conversations.
* **Reusable open-source toolkit** → reduces dev time, increases delivery speed.
* **Clear client upgrade path** → easy to move from demo → production.

## One-liner

**“We give agencies prepaid demos, reusable tools, and a clear upgrade path — so you can impress clients without lock-in or hidden costs.”**
