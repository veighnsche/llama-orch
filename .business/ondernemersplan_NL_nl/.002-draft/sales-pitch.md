# Sales Pitch

## Headline

**Public & Private AI Taps — with a full toolkit for IT teams**

## Short Pitch

I provide a **Public Tap API** for agentic AI and a **Private Tap API** on dedicated GPUs.
On top of that, I deliver a **toolkit** (utils + SDK + applets) so your IT department can easily build, run, and control their own AI tools.

---

## Why it matters

Most companies want AI in production, but they get stuck:

* Tools are scattered, fragile, or locked behind US platforms.
* Compliance rules in the EU demand **transparency, logs, and documentation**.
* IT teams don’t want another black box — they want control.

My offer solves this: simple, transparent, EU-ready.

---

## What you get

### 1. Public Tap (Shared Agentic API)

* Prepaid, shared API endpoint with agentic AI features.
* Works natively with my SDK and utils.
* Or use the OpenAI-compatible adapter for drop-in compatibility.
* Best for demos, pilots, or quick experiments.

---

### 2. Private Tap (Dedicated API on your GPUs)

* Your own API surface on rented GPUs (1×/2×/4×/8×).
* Provisioned and connected with my DevOps scripts in minutes.
* Fully managed by me: monitoring, upgrades, logs, and proofs.
* Best for privacy, performance, and compliance.

---

### 3. Toolkit (Utils + SDK + Applets)

* Written in **TypeScript, JavaScript, and Rust** (Python/Mojo coming soon).
* Includes **deterministic applets** you can trust.
* Lets IT departments create their own AI tools:

  * Codebase maintenance helpers
  * Code review assistants
  * Summarizer AI
  * Document QA tools
  * Internal chat & automation bots
* You control the tools — I just provide the agentic API they run on.

---

## Differentiation (Why me, not others)

* **Proof-driven** → Every deployment comes with logs, metrics, and docs.
* **Open source** → The core orchestrator and utils are inspectable.
* **EU-based** → Data stays in Europe; local and compliant.
* **Independent** → I’m not a hyperscaler, not a faceless platform.
* **Prepaid simplicity** → Credits for Public Tap; GPU-hour packs for Private Tap. No surprises.

## One-liner

**“I give you the taps and the toolkit. You decide what to build — I make sure it runs.”**
