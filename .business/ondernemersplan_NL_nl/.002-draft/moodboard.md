## Purpose

This mood board defines the visual and emotional direction for branding and design.  
It translates the identity of “AI plumbing” into colors, imagery, typography, and style cues.

## Overall Vibe

- **Mechanical but minimal** → pipes, valves, connectors, but not overdone.  
- **Sturdy, functional design** → feels like it works even if design isn’t the focus.  
- **Blue-collar serious** → tradesman aesthetic, honest and robust.  
- **Customer-facing admiration** → diagrams and visuals are clean and neat, not messy.  
- **Slight playfulness** → optional cartoon mascot plumber for warmth and relatability.

## Layout Inspiration

- **Grid-based:** like technical drawings or workshop walls.  
- **Boxed sections:** content in sturdy rectangles, not floating minimalism.  
- **Blueprint overlays:** light grid or faint CAD lines in backgrounds.  
- **Documentation-first:** show logs, charts, and check marks where possible.

## Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Do show pipes, tools, grids, blueprints.  
- ✅ Do use cyan/purple/teal accents for “electrical” feel.  
- ✅ Do make it sturdy, boxy, and robust.  
- ✅ Do keep Vince’s name and face visible in branding.  
- ❌ Don’t use photoreal steel/copper textures.  
- ❌ Don’t lean into startup minimalism or corporate gloss.  
- ❌ Don’t oversell — the logs should speak for themselves.
