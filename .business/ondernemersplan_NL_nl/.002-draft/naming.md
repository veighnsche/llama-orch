# Brand Name Options

## SEO Anchor

We anchor the brand on **“Private LLM Hosting”**, because:

- It is a **high-intent search term** (used by IT managers, compliance officers, funders).  
- It is immediately understandable for Dutch financing partners like Qredits.  
- It avoids confusion with literal plumbing services.  
- It can be localized: **“Private LLM Hosting Netherlands”**.  

Secondary SEO terms to support in copy:  

- “Managed GPU Inference”  
- “Open-source AI Infrastructure”  
- “Agentic API”
