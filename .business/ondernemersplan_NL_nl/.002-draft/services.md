## Overview

I offer three main things as an independent AI plumber:  

1. **Open Source Plumbing (OSS)** – the foundation.  
2. **Public Tap** – shared API with prepaid credits (non-refundable, 12-month validity).  
3. **Private Tap** – dedicated, custom API boxes.  

And one **extra option**:  

- **Custom Toolkit Development** – priority features for the llama-orch toolkit.

## 0) Open Source Plumbing (OSS)

- **What it is:**  
  - The entire llama-orch orchestrator, SDK, and utils are open-source under GPL.  
  - Anyone can inspect, learn, or even start their own AI plumbing setup.  

- **Who it’s for:**  
  - Hobbyists without GPUs.  
  - IT teams experimenting with agentic AI.  
  - Other “AI plumbers” who want to build on top of proven tools.  

- **Why it matters:**  
  - Transparency: nothing is hidden.  
  - Credibility: tools are robust, tested, and documented.  
  - Community: others can adopt or extend the trade.

## 1) Public Tap (Shared Agentic API)

- **What it is:**  
  - A shared API on curated, stable OSS AI models, billed via prepaid credits (non-refundable, 12-month validity).  
  - Prepaid credits; usage decrements balance; service pauses at 0; balance visible via dashboard/API.  
  - Fully compatible with the toolkit and SDK for quick testing.  

- **Who it’s for:**  
  - Developers and startups testing ideas.  
  - Agencies making demos or proof-of-concepts.  
  - IT teams that want to try AI plumbing before committing to infra.  

- **Why it matters:**  
  - Low barrier to entry → anyone can “try the plumbing.”  
  - Recurring revenue stream.  
  - Provides a safe testing environment.

## 2) Private Tap (Dedicated Agentic API)

- **What it is:**  
  - A dedicated, isolated API box provisioned per client.  
  - Supports **any OSS AI model** (e.g. Hugging Face).  
  - GPU scaling options: 1×, 2×, 4×, 8×.  
  - Optional OpenAI-compatible gateway for drop-in usage.  

- **Who it’s for:**  
  - IT departments that need private infra.  
  - Agencies reselling AI plumbing as part of their service.  
  - Companies with compliance or data sensitivity requirements.  

- **Why it matters:**  
  - High-value contracts.  
  - Scalability baked in.  
  - Full control of model choice and API use.  

---

## Extra) Custom Toolkit Development

- **What it is:**  
  - Paid development of new tools or features inside the llama-orch toolkit.  
  - You pay for **priority and custom features**, I contribute reusable parts back to OSS.  
  - Plumbing infra is a separate concern — this is for **tooling expansion**.  

- **Who it’s for:**  
  - Small businesses with specific app needs.  
  - Enterprises that want extensions but don’t want to build them themselves.  

- **Why it matters:**  
  - Keeps the toolkit growing in directions that matter.  
  - High-margin work, but only taken when it pushes the toolkit forward.  
  - Encourages OSS sustainability through sponsored features.

## Summary

- **Everything starts OSS** → transparent, proven tools.  
- **Public Tap** → quick, affordable entry point.  
- **Private Tap** → robust, scalable infra for IT teams and agencies.  
- **Custom Toolkit Dev** → premium option for specialized needs.  

This structure is simple, credible, and sustainable: open foundation, two clear services, one premium extra.
