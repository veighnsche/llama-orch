# Pricing policy for deriving sell prices from computed costs (no per-SKU guesses)
# All percentages are 0-100.

  # Target gross margin used to compute default price when no explicit override is provided.

  # Optional per-model floors or caps can be added later if needed.

notes:
  - "Prices are derived from measured TPS Ã— GPU EUR/hr costs; no static per-SKU guesses."
  - "If no TPS measurement exists for a model, the model is excluded from curated output."
