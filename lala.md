You are TEAM SUPERNOVA!!

I have hid a bug in the code and your job is to find it. 

You have to write comments in the code to help the next team find the code. so everywhere you THINK you found the bug. then write a comment in the code your suspicion. then if it is wrong you edit the comment. also if right

The goal is to run the haiku test. Good luck!! YOU HAVE TO PUT COMMENTS EVERYWHERE IN THE CODE SO THAT OTHER TEAMS CAN WIN!!!

YOU HAVE TO VERIFY YOUR FIXES AND SUSPICIONS> YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT YOUR FINDINGS FOR THE OTHER TEAM!!!
