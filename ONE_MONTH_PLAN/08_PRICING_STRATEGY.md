## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor Pricing

**Strategy:** Show Enterprise (custom) to make Professional (€299) seem reasonable

**Example:**
```
Starter: €99/mo
Professional: €299/mo ← Most Popular
Enterprise: €2,000+/mo
```

**Effect:** Professional seems like good value compared to Enterprise

**Starter:** Basic features  
**Professional:** GDPR endpoints (critical for target market)  
**Enterprise:** Dedicated instances

**Effect:** Forces GDPR-critical customers to Professional+

---

### Overage Pricing

**Strategy:** Make overage more expensive than upgrading

**Starter overage:** €0.20/1K tokens  
**Professional base:** €0.15/1K tokens (included)

**Effect:** Encourages upgrading when approaching limit

---

**Don't:** Panic and over-promise
