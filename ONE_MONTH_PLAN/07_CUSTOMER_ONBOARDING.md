## Support Playbook

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: API Key Not Working**
```
Symptoms:
- 401 Unauthorized errors
- "Invalid API key" messages

Solution:
1. Verify API key format (should start with "llorch_")
2. Check Authorization header: "Bearer [key]"
3. Verify key hasn't expired
4. Regenerate key if needed

Code example:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer llorch_abc123..." \
  https://api.llama-orch.eu/health
```

**Issue 2: Slow Inference**
```
Symptoms:
- Requests taking > 10 seconds
- Timeouts

Solution:
1. Check worker availability
2. Verify model is loaded
3. Check network latency
4. Consider smaller model or fewer tokens

Debugging:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [key]" \
  https://api.llama-orch.eu/workers/status
```

**Issue 3: Audit Log Not Showing**
```
Symptoms:
- Empty audit log
- Missing events

Solution:
1. Verify EU audit mode is enabled
2. Check customer_id in query
3. Verify time range
4. Check permissions

Code example:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [key]" \
  "https://api.llama-orch.eu/audit/events?customer_id=[id]&start_time=2025-10-01"
```

**Issue 4: GDPR Export Failing**
```
Symptoms:
- 500 errors on /gdpr/export
- Incomplete data

Solution:
1. Verify customer_id is correct
2. Check data exists for customer
3. Verify permissions
4. Check audit log size (may timeout if huge)

Code example:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [key]" \
  "https://api.llama-orch.eu/gdpr/export?user_id=[id]" \
  > export.json
```
