- [ ] rbees-orcd accepts jobs
- [ ] Workers execute inference
- [ ] Tokens stream back
- [ ] EU audit toggle works
- [ ] GDPR endpoints functional
- [ ] Web UI deployed

### Marketing (Week 3)

- [ ] Blog post published

### Revenue (Week 4)
- [ ] 1 contract signed
- [ ] Customer onboarded
- [ ] First inference running
- [ ] ‚Ç¨200 MRR achieved

---

## The Reality Check

### Can You Do This in 30 Days?

**Yes, because:**
1. You have 11 shared crates ready
2. Audit logging is already built
3. You're not building from scratch
4. The plan is realistic with buffers

**But you need:**
1. Ruthless focus (cut scope aggressively)
2. Speed (ship fast, iterate)
3. Revenue focus (everything serves first customer)

---

## What to Cut

### Don't Build (Yet)
- ‚ùå pool-managerd daemon (use rbees-pool + SSH)
- ‚ùå SQLite persistence (in-memory is fine)
- ‚ùå Multi-tenancy (single customer per instance)
- ‚ùå Marketplace (M5 is too far)
- ‚ùå Fancy frontend (basic is fine)
- ‚ùå Mobile apps (web only)

### Do Build (Now)
- ‚úÖ rbees-orcd (minimal HTTP server)
- ‚úÖ rbees-pool (CLI)
- ‚úÖ rbees-ctl (CLI)
- ‚úÖ EU audit toggle (use existing crate!)
- ‚úÖ Web UI (basic)
- ‚úÖ Landing page (simple)

---

## Daily Routine

### Morning (4 hours)
- Focus work (coding, building)
- No distractions
- Ship something

### Afternoon (4 hours)
- Testing, polish
- Documentation
- Customer work (Week 3+)

### Evening
- Plan tomorrow
- Reflect on progress
- Rest

---

## The Non-Negotiables

1. **Ship every week** - Something must go live
2. **Talk to customers** - Start Week 3, not Week 4
3. **Cut scope** - If it doesn't make money, don't build it
4. **Focus** - One thing at a time
5. **Revenue** - Everything serves first customer

---
