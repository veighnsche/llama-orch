### Hacker News Post
```
Title: Show HN: llama-orch â€“ EU-Native LLM Inference with GDPR Compliance

Hi HN,

I built llama-orch to solve a problem I had: running LLM inference for EU customers without GDPR headaches.

Key features:
- EU-only data residency (guaranteed)
- Full audit trails (compliance-ready)
- Simple pricing (â‚¬99-299/mo)

Technical stack:
- Rust (orchestrator + worker)
- Vue 3 + TailwindCSS (UI)
- Existing audit-logging crate (immutable, tamper-evident)

The audit logging system is particularly interesting - it has 3 modes:
1. Disabled (homelab, zero overhead)
2. Local (single-node, compliance-safe)
3. Platform (marketplace, centralized)

Open to feedback!

Demo: https://llama-orch.eu
Code: https://github.com/llama-orch/llama-orch (GPL-3.0)
