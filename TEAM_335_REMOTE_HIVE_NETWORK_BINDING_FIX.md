# TEAM-335: Remote Hive Network Binding Fix

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Date:** Oct 27, 2025

## Problem

Remote hive was starting successfully but health checks were failing:
```
üöÄ Starting rbee-hive on vince@192.168.178.29
‚úÖ Daemon started with PID: 221462
üè• Polling health endpoint: http://192.168.178.29:7835/health
üîÑ Attempt 1/30, retrying in 200ms...
üîÑ Attempt 2/30, retrying in 300ms...
... (timeout after 30 attempts)
```

The hive was running, but unreachable from the network.

## Root Cause

The hive was binding to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only):

```rust
// WRONG - Only accessible from the same machine
let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], args.port));
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Health checks work from the same machine: `curl http://localhost:7835/health`
- ‚ùå Health checks fail from remote: `curl http://192.168.178.29:7835/health`

## Solution

Bind to `0.0.0.0` (all network interfaces):

```rust
// CORRECT - Accessible from any network interface
let addr = SocketAddr::from(([0, 0, 0, 0], args.port));
```

This allows:
- ‚úÖ Local access: `http://localhost:7835/health`
- ‚úÖ Remote access: `http://192.168.178.29:7835/health`
- ‚úÖ Health checks from the machine that started the hive

## Fix Applied

**File:** `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs`

```diff
- let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], args.port));
+ // TEAM-335: Bind to 0.0.0.0 to allow remote access (needed for remote hives)
+ // Localhost-only binding (127.0.0.1) would prevent health checks from remote machines
+ let addr = SocketAddr::from(([0, 0, 0, 0], args.port));
```

## Verification

```bash
# Rebuild hive
cargo build --release -p rbee-hive
‚úÖ Build successful

# Stop old hive
./rbee hive stop -a workstation
‚úÖ Daemon stopped

# Reinstall new hive
./rbee hive install -a workstation
‚úÖ rbee-hive installed successfully

# Start hive
./rbee hive start -a workstation
‚úÖ SUCCESS!

Output:
üöÄ Starting rbee-hive on vince@192.168.178.29
‚úÖ Daemon started with PID: 222313
üè• Polling health endpoint: http://192.168.178.29:7835/health
‚úÖ daemon is healthy (attempt 1)  ‚Üê First attempt!
üéâ rbee-hive started successfully
```

## Network Binding Explained

### `127.0.0.1` (Localhost Only)
- Only accessible from the same machine
- Use for: Local-only services
- Example: Development servers

### `0.0.0.0` (All Interfaces)
- Accessible from any network interface
- Use for: Services that need remote access
- Example: Production servers, remote daemons

## Why This Matters

For **remote hive management**, the workflow is:

```text
Local Machine (rbee-keeper)
    ‚Üì SSH
Remote Machine (rbee-hive)
    ‚Üì Start daemon
Remote Machine (rbee-hive listening on 0.0.0.0:7835)
    ‚Üë HTTP health check
Local Machine (polls http://192.168.178.29:7835/health)
```

If the hive binds to `127.0.0.1`, the health check from the local machine fails because it can't reach the hive over the network.

## Security Considerations

**Q:** Is binding to `0.0.0.0` secure?

**A:** Yes, for a trusted local network:
- The hive is on your home network (192.168.178.x)
- It's behind your router/firewall
- Only machines on your LAN can access it

For production, you might want:
- Firewall rules to restrict access
- TLS/HTTPS for encrypted communication
- Authentication/authorization

But for local development and homelab use, `0.0.0.0` is fine.

## Files Changed

- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs` (1 line changed, 2 lines added for comments)

## Complete Remote Hive Workflow

Now working end-to-end:

```bash
# 1. Install hive on remote machine
./rbee hive install -a workstation
‚úÖ rbee-hive installed successfully on vince@192.168.178.29

# 2. Start hive on remote machine
./rbee hive start -a workstation
‚úÖ rbee-hive started successfully on vince@192.168.178.29

# 3. Check hive status
./rbee hive status -a workstation
‚úÖ hive 'workstation' is running on http://192.168.178.29:7835

# 4. Stop hive on remote machine
./rbee hive stop -a workstation
‚úÖ Daemon stopped after SIGTERM
```

## Summary of Fixes

This session fixed THREE issues:

1. **TEAM-335a:** Hive health check URL missing `/health` path
   - Fixed: `HttpDaemonConfig::new()` now gets full health URL

2. **TEAM-335b:** SSH config parser not handling multiple aliases
   - Fixed: Parser now creates entry for each alias

3. **TEAM-335c:** Hive binding to localhost only
   - Fixed: Hive now binds to `0.0.0.0` for remote access

**Remote hive management now works perfectly!** üöÄ
