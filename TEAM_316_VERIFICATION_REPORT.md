# TEAM-316: Contract Implementation Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Reviewer:** TEAM-316  
**Subject:** Verification of TEAM-315's contract implementation

---

## Executive Summary

❌ **INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

TEAM-315 created the contract crates but **DID NOT FULLY MIGRATE** existing code to use them.

**Critical Issues:**
1. ❌ daemon-lifecycle still has duplicate types (should use daemon-contract)
2. ❌ tauri_commands still has duplicate SshTarget (should use ssh-contract)
3. ❌ hive-lifecycle does NOT use daemon-contract at all
4. ❌ No HiveHandle type alias created

---

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ PASS: Contract Crates Created

All three contract crates exist and have proper implementation:

1. **daemon-contract** ✅
   - Location: `/bin/97_contracts/daemon-contract/`
   - Types: DaemonHandle, StatusRequest, StatusResponse, InstallConfig, InstallResult, HttpDaemonConfig, ShutdownConfig
   - Tests: 12 tests passing
   - Documentation: Complete with examples

2. **ssh-contract** ✅
   - Location: `/bin/97_contracts/ssh-contract/`
   - Types: SshTarget, SshTargetStatus
   - Tests: 6 tests passing
   - Documentation: Complete with examples

3. **keeper-config-contract** ✅
   - Location: `/bin/97_contracts/keeper-config-contract/`
   - Types: KeeperConfig, ValidationError
   - Tests: 6 tests passing
   - Documentation: Complete with examples

---

### ❌ FAIL: daemon-lifecycle Not Migrated

**Location:** `/bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/`

**Problem:** daemon-lifecycle STILL defines its own types instead of using daemon-contract

**Evidence:**

```rust
// File: daemon-lifecycle/src/status.rs (lines 14-38)
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct StatusRequest {
    pub id: String,
    pub health_url: String,
    pub daemon_type: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize)]
pub struct StatusResponse {
    pub id: String,
    pub running: bool,
    pub health_url: String,
}
```

```rust
// File: daemon-lifecycle/src/install.rs (lines 13-35)
pub struct InstallConfig {
    pub binary_name: String,
    pub binary_path: Option<String>,
    pub target_path: Option<String>,
    pub job_id: Option<String>,
}

pub struct InstallResult {
    pub binary_path: String,
    pub found_in_target: bool,
}
```

```rust
// File: daemon-lifecycle/src/lifecycle.rs (line 19)
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct HttpDaemonConfig {
    pub daemon_name: String,
    pub health_url: String,
    pub shutdown_endpoint: Option<String>,
    pub job_id: Option<String>,
}
```

```rust
// File: daemon-lifecycle/src/shutdown.rs (line 13)
pub struct ShutdownConfig {
    pub daemon_name: String,
    pub pid: u32,
    pub graceful_timeout_secs: u64,
    pub job_id: Option<String>,
}
```

**Missing Dependency:**

```toml
# File: daemon-lifecycle/Cargo.toml
# NO daemon-contract dependency!
```

**What Should Have Been Done:**

1. Add `daemon-contract = { path = "../../97_contracts/daemon-contract" }` to Cargo.toml
2. Replace local type definitions with `pub use daemon_contract::*;`
3. Delete duplicate types from daemon-lifecycle

**Impact:** HIGH - All code using daemon-lifecycle gets duplicate types instead of contracts

---

### ❌ FAIL: tauri_commands Still Has Duplicate SshTarget

**Location:** `/bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/tauri_commands.rs`

**Problem:** tauri_commands defines its own SshTarget/SshTargetStatus instead of using ssh-contract

**Evidence:**

```rust
// File: tauri_commands.rs (lines 43-66)
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Type)]
pub struct SshTarget {
    pub host: String,
    pub host_subtitle: Option<String>,
    pub hostname: String,
    pub user: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub status: SshTargetStatus,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Type)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
pub enum SshTargetStatus {
    Online,
    Offline,
    Unknown,
}
```

Then converts FROM ssh-contract types (line 69):

```rust
impl From<ssh_config::SshTarget> for SshTarget {
    fn from(target: ssh_config::SshTarget) -> Self {
        Self {
            host: target.host,
            // ... manual field mapping
        }
    }
}
```

**What Should Have Been Done:**

1. Remove duplicate types from tauri_commands.rs
2. Use `ssh_contract::{SshTarget, SshTargetStatus}` directly
3. Add Tauri's `Type` derive to ssh-contract types if needed

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Duplication between ssh-contract and tauri_commands

---

### ❌ FAIL: hive-lifecycle Doesn't Use daemon-contract

**Location:** `/bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/hive-lifecycle/`

**Problem:** hive-lifecycle does NOT use daemon-contract at all

**Evidence:**

```toml
# File: hive-lifecycle/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["process", "io-util", "rt"] }
reqwest = "0.12"
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
daemon-lifecycle = { path = "../../99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle" }
observability-narration-core = { path = "../../99_shared_crates/narration-core" }
ssh-config = { path = "../ssh-config" }
stdext = "0.3"

# NO daemon-contract dependency!
```

**What Should Have Been Done:**

According to TEAM-314's plan (TEAM_314_DAEMON_CONTRACT_IMPLEMENTATION.md):

1. Add `daemon-contract` dependency to hive-lifecycle
2. Create `HiveHandle` type alias:
   ```rust
   pub type HiveHandle = daemon_contract::DaemonHandle;
   ```
3. Use daemon-contract types for install/status/lifecycle operations

**Current State:**
- No HiveHandle exists
- No daemon-contract dependency
- Uses daemon-lifecycle types (which are duplicates)

**Impact:** HIGH - hive-lifecycle doesn't benefit from contracts

---

### ✅ PARTIAL PASS: Some Crates Do Use Contracts

**queen-lifecycle:** ✅ Uses daemon-contract

```rust
// File: queen-lifecycle/src/types.rs
// TEAM-315: Use generic DaemonHandle from contract
pub use daemon_contract::DaemonHandle as QueenHandle;
```

```toml
# File: queen-lifecycle/Cargo.toml
daemon-contract = { path = "../../97_contracts/daemon-contract" }  # TEAM-315: Generic daemon handle
```

**ssh-config:** ✅ Uses ssh-contract

```rust
// File: ssh-config/src/lib.rs
// TEAM-315: Use SSH types from contract
pub use ssh_contract::{SshTarget, SshTargetStatus};
```

```toml
# File: ssh-config/Cargo.toml
ssh-contract = { path = "../../97_contracts/ssh-contract" }
```

**rbee-keeper/config.rs:** ✅ Uses keeper-config-contract

```rust
// File: rbee-keeper/src/config.rs
// TEAM-315: Use KeeperConfig from contract
pub use keeper_config_contract::KeeperConfig;
```

```toml
# File: rbee-keeper/Cargo.toml
keeper-config-contract = { path = "../97_contracts/keeper-config-contract" }  # TEAM-315
```

## Missing Work Summary

### 1. daemon-lifecycle Migration (CRITICAL)

**Files to Update:**
- `/bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/Cargo.toml` - Add daemon-contract dependency
- `/bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/status.rs` - Use daemon_contract::StatusRequest/Response
- `/bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/install.rs` - Use daemon_contract::InstallConfig/Result
- `/bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/lifecycle.rs` - Use daemon_contract::HttpDaemonConfig
- `/bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/shutdown.rs` - Use daemon_contract::ShutdownConfig

**Steps:**
1. Add `daemon-contract = { path = "../../97_contracts/daemon-contract" }` to Cargo.toml
2. Replace type definitions with `pub use daemon_contract::*;`
3. Fix field mismatches (daemon-lifecycle types have extra fields)
4. Update all functions to use contract types
5. Run tests to verify

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### 2. tauri_commands Duplication Removal (HIGH)

**Files to Update:**
- `/bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/tauri_commands.rs` - Remove duplicate types

**Steps:**
1. Delete local SshTarget/SshTargetStatus definitions (lines 43-66)
2. Import from ssh-contract: `use ssh_contract::{SshTarget, SshTargetStatus};`
3. Remove the From<ssh_config::SshTarget> conversion (no longer needed)
4. Add Tauri's `Type` derive to ssh-contract if needed
5. Run tests to verify

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

### 3. hive-lifecycle Contract Usage (MEDIUM)

**Files to Update:**
- `/bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/hive-lifecycle/Cargo.toml` - Add daemon-contract dependency
- `/bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` - Add HiveHandle type alias

**Steps:**
1. Add `daemon-contract = { path = "../../97_contracts/daemon-contract" }` to Cargo.toml
2. Add to lib.rs:
   ```rust
   // TEAM-316: Use generic DaemonHandle from daemon-contract
   pub type HiveHandle = daemon_contract::DaemonHandle;
   ```
3. Consider using daemon-contract types for operations (optional, if daemon-lifecycle is fixed)
4. Run tests to verify

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

## Type Mismatches Found

### StatusRequest

**daemon-contract version:**
```rust
pub struct StatusRequest {
    pub id: String,
    pub job_id: Option<String>,
}
```

**daemon-lifecycle version:**
```rust
pub struct StatusRequest {
    pub id: String,
    pub health_url: String,        // ← Extra field
    pub daemon_type: Option<String>, // ← Extra field
}
```

**Resolution:** daemon-lifecycle has extra fields for implementation convenience. These should be parameters to functions, not in the contract type.

---

### StatusResponse

**daemon-contract version:**
```rust
pub struct StatusResponse {
    pub id: String,
    pub is_running: bool,
    pub health_status: Option<String>,
    pub metadata: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}
```

**daemon-lifecycle version:**
```rust
pub struct StatusResponse {
    pub id: String,
    pub running: bool,           // ← Different field name
    pub health_url: String,      // ← Extra field
}
```

**Resolution:** Field name mismatch (`is_running` vs `running`) and extra field. Contract version is better.

---

### InstallResult

**daemon-contract version:**
```rust
pub struct InstallResult {
    pub binary_path: String,
    pub install_time: SystemTime,
}
```

**daemon-lifecycle version:**
```rust
pub struct InstallResult {
    pub binary_path: String,
    pub found_in_target: bool,   // ← Different field
}
```

**Resolution:** Different fields. Need to decide which is authoritative.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required)

1. **CRITICAL:** Migrate daemon-lifecycle to use daemon-contract
   - Highest impact
   - Affects all daemons
   - Resolve type mismatches first

2. **HIGH:** Remove SshTarget duplication from tauri_commands
   - Clear duplication
   - Easy fix
   - No type mismatches

3. **MEDIUM:** Add daemon-contract dependency to hive-lifecycle
   - Create HiveHandle type alias
   - Consider using contract types

### Design Decisions Needed

1. **StatusRequest fields:** Should contract type include `health_url` and `daemon_type`?
   - **Recommendation:** No. These are implementation details, not contract.
   - **Resolution:** Make them function parameters

2. **StatusResponse field names:** `is_running` (contract) vs `running` (lifecycle)?
   - **Recommendation:** Use contract version (`is_running`)
   - **Resolution:** Update daemon-lifecycle to match

3. **InstallResult fields:** `install_time` (contract) vs `found_in_target` (lifecycle)?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep both versions or add to contract
   - **Resolution:** Add `found_in_target` to contract

## Conclusion

**TEAM-315 Status:** ❌ INCOMPLETE

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Created 3 contract crates with proper structure
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests
- ✅ Added documentation
- ✅ Migrated queen-lifecycle to use daemon-contract
- ✅ Migrated ssh-config to use ssh-contract
- ✅ Migrated rbee-keeper/config to use keeper-config-contract

**What Was NOT Done:**
- ❌ Migrate daemon-lifecycle to use daemon-contract
- ❌ Remove SshTarget duplication from tauri_commands
- ❌ Add daemon-contract to hive-lifecycle
- ❌ Create HiveHandle type alias
- ❌ Resolve type mismatches between contracts and implementation

**Overall Assessment:**
TEAM-315 did the EASY part (creating contracts) but skipped the HARD part (migrating existing code). The contracts exist but are only partially used, leaving significant duplication in the codebase.

**Required Work Remaining:** ~4-5 hours
