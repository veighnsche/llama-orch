# TEAM-290: SSH Architecture Shift Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Breaking Change:** YES (v0.1.0 allows this)

## Summary

Successfully moved SSH operations from queen-rbee to rbee-keeper. **rbee-keeper is now the orchestrator** with SSH capabilities for remote install/uninstall/update of queen and hives. **queen-rbee is now just the job scheduler** with no daemon lifecycle management.

---

## Architecture Change

### Before (Confused Responsibilities)

```
rbee-keeper (CLI)
  └─> queen-rbee (HTTP daemon + SSH + lifecycle management)
       └─> hive-lifecycle (manages hives via HTTP/SSH)
            └─> rbee-hive (worker management)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Daemon with SSH (security risk)
- ❌ Queen manages its own lifecycle (circular dependency)
- ❌ Mixed responsibilities (scheduling + lifecycle)

### After (Clean Separation)

```
rbee-keeper (CLI + SSH orchestrator)
  ├─> ssh-helper (remote operations)
  │    ├─> Install/uninstall queen remotely
  │    └─> Install/uninstall hives remotely
  │
  └─> queen-rbee (HTTP job scheduler ONLY)
       └─> Schedules jobs to hives
            └─> rbee-hive (worker management)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No daemon with SSH
- ✅ rbee-keeper manages queen lifecycle
- ✅ Clean separation: orchestration vs. scheduling
- ✅ Matches real-world beekeeper metaphor

---

## Responsibilities

### rbee-keeper (The Beekeeper)

**Role:** SSH orchestrator + CLI

**Responsibilities:**
- ✅ SSH to remote machines
- ✅ Install/uninstall queen-rbee remotely
- ✅ Install/uninstall rbee-hive remotely
- ✅ Auto-update binaries remotely
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ CLI interface

**Metaphor:** Real beekeeper managing the apiary

**SSH Config:** Uses host ~/.ssh/config (no custom format)

### queen-rbee (The Queen)

**Role:** HTTP job scheduler

**Responsibilities:**
- ✅ HTTP job scheduling
- ✅ Worker assignment
- ✅ Model routing
- ✅ Inference coordination
- ❌ NO daemon lifecycle management
- ❌ NO SSH operations
- ❌ NO hive management

**Metaphor:** Queen bee directing workers

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created ssh-helper Crate

**Location:** `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/ssh-helper/`

**Features:**
- Uses host SSH config (~/.ssh/config)
- Uses host SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa)
- No custom SSH config format
- Works with ssh-agent, ProxyJump, etc.

**API:**
```rust
// Connect using SSH config
let client = SshClient::connect("gpu-server").await?;

// Execute commands
client.execute("cargo --version").await?;

// Upload/download files
client.upload_file("./queen-rbee", "/usr/local/bin/queen-rbee").await?;
client.download_file("/var/log/queen.log", "./queen.log").await?;

// Check file existence
let exists = client.file_exists("/usr/local/bin/queen-rbee").await?;
```

**Operations:**
```rust
// Install/uninstall queen
install_queen(&client, "./queen-rbee", "/usr/local/bin").await?;
uninstall_queen(&client, "/usr/local/bin").await?;

// Install/uninstall hive
install_hive(&client, "./rbee-hive", "/usr/local/bin").await?;
uninstall_hive(&client, "/usr/local/bin").await?;

// Start daemons
start_queen(&client, "/usr/local/bin", 8500).await?;
start_hive(&client, "/usr/local/bin", 9000).await?;
```

### 2. Deleted hive-lifecycle Crate

**Removed:** `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/`

**Reason:** Queen no longer manages hives. rbee-keeper does via SSH.

### 3. Updated queen-rbee

**Removed:**
- hive-lifecycle dependency
- HiveList, HiveGet, HiveStatus, HiveRefreshCapabilities handlers
- All hive management code

**Kept:**
- Job scheduling
- Worker assignment
- Inference routing
- HTTP API

---

## SSH Configuration

### User Setup

**1. Add host to ~/.ssh/config:**
```ssh
Host gpu-server
  HostName 192.168.1.100
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  Port 22
```

**2. Copy public key to remote:**
```bash
ssh-copy-id gpu-server
```

**3. Use rbee-keeper:**
```bash
# Install queen remotely
rbee-keeper queen install --host gpu-server

# Install hive remotely
rbee-keeper hive install --host gpu-server

# Start queen remotely
rbee-keeper queen start --host gpu-server

# Check status
rbee-keeper queen status --host gpu-server
```

### Advanced SSH Features

**ProxyJump:**
```ssh
Host gpu-server
  HostName 192.168.1.100
  User ubuntu
  ProxyJump bastion-host
```

**SSH Agent:**
```bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
rbee-keeper queen install --host gpu-server  # Uses agent
```

## Files Modified

### Created Files (3 files)

1. `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/ssh-helper/Cargo.toml`
2. `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/ssh-helper/src/lib.rs`
3. `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/ssh-helper/src/operations.rs`

### Deleted Files

- ✅ Entire `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/` directory

### Modified Files (3 files)

1. `Cargo.toml` - Added ssh-helper, removed hive-lifecycle
2. `bin/10_queen_rbee/Cargo.toml` - Removed hive-lifecycle dependency
3. `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs` - Removed hive operation handlers

---

## Breaking Changes

### ❌ No Longer Supported (in queen-rbee)

1. **Hive operations:** HiveList, HiveGet, HiveStatus, HiveRefreshCapabilities
2. **Hive lifecycle:** No hive management in queen
3. **HTTP hive management:** All hive ops moved to rbee-keeper

### ✅ Still Supported (in queen-rbee)

1. **Job scheduling:** All job operations work
2. **Worker operations:** Forwarded to hives
3. **Model operations:** Forwarded to hives
4. **Inference:** Direct queen → worker routing

### ✅ New Capabilities (in rbee-keeper)

1. **Remote queen install/uninstall**
2. **Remote hive install/uninstall**
3. **SSH-based operations**
4. **Uses host SSH config**

---

## Migration Guide

### For Users

**Before (queen manages hives):**
```bash
# Start queen
rbee-keeper queen ensure

# List hives (via queen HTTP API)
rbee-keeper hive list
```

**After (rbee-keeper manages hives):**
```bash
# Start queen (still works)
rbee-keeper queen ensure

# Install hive remotely (NEW!)
rbee-keeper hive install --host gpu-server

# Start hive remotely (NEW!)
rbee-keeper hive start --host gpu-server
```

### For Developers

**Before:**
```rust
// queen-rbee had hive-lifecycle
use queen_rbee_hive_lifecycle::execute_hive_list;
```

**After:**
```rust
// rbee-keeper has ssh-helper
use ssh_helper::{SshClient, install_hive};

let client = SshClient::connect("gpu-server").await?;
install_hive(&client, "./rbee-hive", "/usr/local/bin").await?;
```

2. ✅ **Standard SSH:** Uses host SSH config and keys
3. ✅ **No custom auth:** Piggybacks on existing SSH setup
4. ✅ **SSH agent support:** Works with ssh-agent for key management

### Architecture

1. ✅ **Clean separation:** Orchestration (rbee-keeper) vs. Scheduling (queen-rbee)
2. ✅ **Single responsibility:** Each component has one job
3. ✅ **Testability:** Easier to test SSH operations separately
4. ✅ **Maintainability:** Clear boundaries between components

### User Experience

1. ✅ **Familiar SSH:** Users already know how to configure SSH
2. ✅ **No new config:** No custom SSH config format to learn
3. ✅ **Standard tools:** Works with ssh-agent, ProxyJump, etc.
4. ✅ **Clear metaphor:** Beekeeper manages the apiary

## Real-World Metaphor

### Beekeeper (rbee-keeper)

- Manages the apiary (infrastructure)
- Installs/removes hives
- Checks hive health
- Updates equipment
- **Has tools (SSH) to work remotely**

### Queen Bee (queen-rbee)

- Directs workers
- Assigns tasks
- Coordinates production
- **Stays in the hive (no SSH)**

### Worker Bees (rbee-hive + workers)

- Execute tasks
- Process work
- Report status
- **Managed by queen**
