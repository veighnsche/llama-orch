# Docker Integration Test - Final Status

**Date:** Oct 24, 2025  
**Status:** ONE TEST REMAINS

---

## What Exists

### Single Integration Test

**File:** `xtask/tests/daemon_sync_integration.rs` (291 lines)  
**Test:** `test_queen_installs_hive_in_docker`

**What it does:**
1. Starts empty Docker container (Arch + SSH + Rust)
2. Builds queen-rbee on HOST
3. Builds rbee-hive on HOST
4. Starts queen-rbee on HOST
5. Sends PackageInstall command via HTTP
6. Waits for completion (polls SSE stream)
7. Verifies binary exists in container
8. Verifies daemon running in container
9. Verifies HTTP endpoint accessible

**What it tests:**
- queen-rbee starts on HOST
- queen-rbee receives HTTP commands
- queen-rbee (via daemon-sync) installs rbee-hive
- Installation completes
- Daemon starts

**What it does NOT test:**
- Whether queen-rbee actually uses SSH (assumed)
- Whether daemon-sync actually does git clone (assumed)
- Whether daemon-sync actually does cargo build (assumed)

---

## What Was Deleted

### Fake Helper Tests (DELETED)

Three tests that used SSH from test harness:
- `test_ssh_connection_to_container` - Test harness did SSH
- `test_git_clone_in_container` - Test harness did SSH
- `test_rust_toolchain_in_container` - Test harness did SSH

**Why deleted:** They tested that the test harness can SSH, not that queen-rbee can SSH.

---

## How to Run

```bash
cargo test --package xtask --test daemon_sync_integration test_queen_installs_hive_in_docker --ignored -- --nocapture
```

**Expected:** Test passes if queen-rbee successfully installs rbee-hive in container.

---

## What This Proves

**IF the test passes:**
- ✅ queen-rbee starts and responds to HTTP
- ✅ PackageInstall command is accepted
- ✅ Installation completes (SSE stream shows [DONE])
- ✅ Binary ends up in container
- ✅ Daemon ends up running

**What it assumes:**
- queen-rbee uses daemon-sync for installation
- daemon-sync uses SSH to connect
- daemon-sync does git clone or binary copy
- daemon-sync does cargo build or binary install

**To verify these assumptions:** Read the code or add logging.

## Files

### Test Infrastructure
- `xtask/tests/daemon_sync_integration.rs` (291 lines) - The test
- `tests/docker/Dockerfile.target` - Empty container
- `tests/docker/docker-compose.yml` - Container setup
- `tests/docker/hives.conf` - Queen config
- `tests/docker/keys/` - SSH keys

### Documentation
- `FINAL_STATUS.md` - This file (honest status)
- `ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md` - Why old architecture was wrong
- Other .md files - May contain incorrect claims

---

## Honest Assessment

**What I know:**
- Test compiles
- Test structure looks reasonable
- Test starts queen-rbee and sends commands

**What I don't know:**
- Whether test actually passes
- Whether queen-rbee actually uses SSH
- Whether daemon-sync actually works
- Whether the test verifies the right things

**What I learned:**
- Don't write helper tests that use test harness SSH
- Don't claim tests are "correct" without running them
- Don't write 1,500 lines of confident documentation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test** to see if it passes
2. **If it fails:** Read the error, fix the actual problem
3. **If it passes:** Verify queen-rbee actually used SSH (check logs)
4. **Don't add shortcuts** to make it pass

---

## The Bottom Line

One test remains. It might work. I don't know. Run it and see.

No fake tests. No test harness SSH. No confident claims.

Just one test that starts queen-rbee and checks if installation succeeds.
