# Docker Integration Test - Current Status

**Date:** Oct 24, 2025  
**Status:** PARTIAL SUCCESS

---

## What Works

✅ **Container starts** - Empty Arch Linux with SSH  
✅ **Binaries build** - queen-rbee and rbee-hive compile  
✅ **queen-rbee starts** - Runs on host, responds to HTTP  
✅ **Job submission** - PackageInstall command accepted  
✅ **SSE stream** - Shows [DONE] marker  

---

## What Doesn't Work

❌ **Binary installation** - rbee-hive not installed in container  
❌ **Daemon startup** - No daemon running (because no binary)  

---

## What Happened

1. Container started successfully
2. queen-rbee built and started on host
3. PackageInstall command sent via HTTP
4. Job accepted, SSE stream showed [DONE]
5. **BUT: No binary was installed in container**

---

## Why It Failed

The `PackageInstall` operation is either:
- Not implemented yet
- Implemented but doesn't actually install binaries
- Requires different parameters
- Expects different config format

## Test Output

```
🐝 TEAM-282: Full daemon-sync integration test
============================================================

📦 STEP 1: Starting empty target container...
✅ Container SSH ready

🔨 STEP 2: Building queen-rbee on HOST...
✅ queen-rbee built on HOST

🔨 STEP 3: Building rbee-hive on HOST...
✅ rbee-hive built on HOST

👑 STEP 4: Starting queen-rbee on HOST...
✅ queen-rbee is running on http://localhost:8500

📡 STEP 5: Sending PackageInstall command...
📨 Response: {"job_id":"...","sse_url":"..."}
✅ Job submitted: job-...

⏳ STEP 6: Waiting for installation to complete...
✅ Installation complete (attempt 1)

🔍 STEP 7: Verifying binary installation...
❌ rbee-hive binary not found in container

FAILED: Binary not installed
```

## Container State

```bash
# Directory exists but is empty
$ docker exec rbee-test-target ls -la /home/rbee/.local/bin/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 1 rbee rbee 4096 Oct 24 11:13 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 rbee rbee 4096 Oct 24 11:13 ..

# No rbee binaries found
$ docker exec rbee-test-target find /home/rbee -name "*rbee*"
/home/rbee
/home/rbee/.config/rbee
/home/rbee/.local/share/rbee
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Check if PackageInstall is implemented**
   - Look at job_router.rs
   - See what PackageInstall actually does

2. **Check SSE stream output**
   - What did the job actually do?
   - Were there errors in the stream?

3. **Try different operation**
   - Maybe use HiveInstall instead?
   - Maybe PackageInstall isn't the right operation?

4. **Check daemon-sync**
   - Is daemon-sync implemented?
   - Does it actually SSH and install?

---

## What The Test Proves So Far

✅ Container infrastructure works  
✅ queen-rbee starts and accepts commands  
✅ Job system works (submission + SSE)  
❌ Installation doesn't actually happen  

---

## Honest Assessment

The test infrastructure is correct:
- Host → Container architecture
- queen-rbee runs on host
- No fake SSH from test harness
- Proper verification

The product functionality is incomplete:
- PackageInstall doesn't install binaries
- Or it's not implemented yet
- Or it needs different config

**The test correctly identified that installation doesn't work.**

This is what tests are supposed to do: find problems.
