## 🚀 Quick Start (Copy & Paste)

### Option 1: Midjourney (Recommended)

```
/imagine high-contrast cinematic photoreal illustration, cozy homelab desk at night, small rack of GPUs glowing warm amber, laptop showing terminal logs streaming tokens in green monospace font, sticky note on monitor reads "your models your rules", deep midnight blue palette (#0f172a background), soft amber rim light from GPUs, subtle bokeh depth of field, warm desk lamp, mechanical keyboard, coffee mug, evokes sovereignty and calm focus, professional photography style, shallow depth of field, 1080x760, --ar 3:2 --style raw --v 6
```

### Option 2: DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT Plus)

```
Create a cinematic, photoreal illustration of a cozy homelab desk at night. FOREGROUND: A laptop displaying terminal logs with green text streaming tokens (code-like output). MIDDLE: A small rack or tower of 2-3 GPUs with warm amber LED glow. A sticky note on the monitor reads "your models, your rules" in handwriting. BACKGROUND: Deep midnight blue (#0f172a), soft bokeh effect. LIGHTING: Warm amber rim light from the GPUs, soft desk lamp creating intimate atmosphere. MOOD: Calm, focused, sovereign control. STYLE: Professional photography, shallow depth of field, cinematic color grading. Include: mechanical keyboard, coffee mug. 1080x760 pixels, 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

### Option 3: Stable Diffusion (ComfyUI/Automatic1111)

**Positive Prompt:**
```
cinematic photoreal illustration, cozy homelab desk night scene, laptop terminal logs streaming tokens green monospace text, small GPU rack glowing warm amber LEDs, sticky note "your models your rules" handwritten, deep midnight blue background #0f172a, soft rim lighting from GPUs, subtle bokeh depth of field, warm desk lamp, mechanical keyboard, coffee mug steam, professional photography, shallow dof, cinematic color grading, evokes sovereignty calm focus, intimate atmosphere, high detail, 3:2 aspect ratio
```

**Negative Prompt:**
```
cluttered, messy, bright lights, daylight, multiple monitors, cables everywhere, gaming RGB, loud colors, low quality, blurry, text artifacts, watermark, people, hands

## 📋 Key Visual Elements

### Must Have:

1. ✅ **Laptop** (center-left)
   - Terminal window open
   - Green monospace text streaming (like tokens being generated)
   - Visible code/logs output
   - Soft glow from screen

2. ✅ **GPU rack/tower** (right side)
   - 2-3 GPUs visible
   - Warm amber LED glow (#f59e0b)
   - Small, desktop-sized rack or tower
   - Professional, not gaming RGB

3. ✅ **Sticky note** on monitor
   - Handwritten text: "your models, your rules"

   - Casual, personal touch

4. ✅ **Desk accessories**:
   - Mechanical keyboard (subtle, not RGB)
   - Coffee mug (with steam optional)
   - Warm desk lamp (soft light)
   - Clean, minimal desk surface

5. ✅ **Lighting & Mood**:
   - Deep midnight blue background (#0f172a)
   - Warm amber rim light from GPUs
   - Soft bokeh effect (shallow depth of field)
   - Intimate, focused atmosphere
   - Night scene (no windows/daylight)

6. ✅ **Emotional tone**:

## 📐 Composition Guidelines

**Rule of Thirds:**
- Laptop: Left third
- GPU rack: Right third
- Sticky note: Upper center (focal point)

**Depth Layers:**
1. Foreground: Keyboard (slightly out of focus)
2. Middle: Laptop screen (sharp focus) + sticky note
3. Background: GPU rack (soft glow) + bokeh

**Visual Flow:**
Eyes should move: Sticky note → Terminal logs → GPU glow
