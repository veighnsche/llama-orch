# ‚úÖ Port Clarification Added

**Created by:** TEAM-FE-000  
**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ

---

## üö® What Was Clarified

Added **PROMINENT sections** to make it crystal clear this is a **PORT FROM REACT**, not a new project.

---

## üìù Where It Was Added

### 1. TEAM-FE-001 Kickoff (Top of File)

**File:** `/frontend/libs/storybook/.handoffs/TEAM-FE-001-KICKOFF.md`

**Added Section:**
```markdown
## üö® CRITICAL: THIS IS A PORT FROM REACT

**YOU ARE NOT DESIGNING FROM SCRATCH. YOU ARE PORTING EXISTING REACT COMPONENTS TO VUE.**

### What This Means:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Read the React reference component FIRST
- Port the exact same behavior to Vue
- Match the visual design exactly
- Use the same props (converted to Vue syntax)
- Keep the same variants and states
- Compare side-by-side with React reference

‚ùå **DO NOT:**
- Design new components from scratch
- Guess how components should work
- Change behavior without approval
- Invent new features
- Skip reading the React reference

### React Reference Location:

**Path:** `/frontend/reference/v0/components/ui/`  
**Run:** `pnpm --filter frontend/reference/v0 dev`  
**URL:** http://localhost:3000

**Every component you build has a React version to port from.**
```

---

### 2. React to Vue Port Plan (Top of File)

**File:** `/frontend/bin/commercial-frontend/REACT_TO_VUE_PORT_PLAN.md`

**Added Section:**
```markdown
## üö® CRITICAL: THIS IS A PORT, NOT A NEW PROJECT

**YOU ARE PORTING EXISTING REACT COMPONENTS TO VUE. NOT BUILDING FROM SCRATCH.**

### What This Means:

‚úÖ **Every component has a React reference to port from**  
‚úÖ **Visual design is already done**  
‚úÖ **Behavior is already defined**  
‚úÖ **Props are already documented**  
‚úÖ **You just need to convert React ‚Üí Vue**

‚ùå **DO NOT:**
- Design new components
- Guess how things should work
- Change behavior without approval
- Skip reading the React reference

### React Reference:

**Location:** `/frontend/reference/v0/`  
**Components:** `/frontend/reference/v0/components/ui/`  
**Run:** `pnpm --filter frontend/reference/v0 dev`  
**URL:** http://localhost:3000

**ALWAYS compare your Vue component with the React reference side-by-side.**
```

- Impossible to miss
- Clear DO/DO NOT lists

---

## ‚úÖ What Teams Now Know

When teams open the kickoff or port plan, they **IMMEDIATELY** see:

1. **This is a port** - Not a new project
2. **React reference exists** - For every component
3. **Visual design is done** - Just port it
4. **Behavior is defined** - Don't guess
5. **Compare side-by-side** - Required workflow
6. **React reference location** - Path, command, URL

---

## üö® Key Messages

### Message 1: "YOU ARE PORTING"
Not designing, not guessing, not inventing. **PORTING.**

### Message 2: "REACT REFERENCE EXISTS"
Every component has a React version. **READ IT FIRST.**

### Message 3: "MATCH EXACTLY"
Visual design, behavior, props. **EXACT MATCH REQUIRED.**

### Message 4: "COMPARE SIDE-BY-SIDE"
React (port 3000) vs Vue (port 5173). **ALWAYS COMPARE.**
