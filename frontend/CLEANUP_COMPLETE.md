## 📁 New Structure

```
frontend/
├── bin/
│   ├── commercial-frontend/     # Vue 3 (was commercial-frontend-v2)
│   └── d3-sim-frontend/         # D3 simulation
├── libs/

## 📦 Workspace Configuration

**Before:**
```yaml
packages:
  - frontend/bin/commercial-frontend      # v1
  - frontend/bin/commercial-frontend-v2   # v2
```

**After:**
```yaml
packages:
  - frontend/bin/commercial-frontend      # Main (was v2)
```

## 🎯 Updated Commands

### Run Commercial Frontend

**Before:**
```bash
pnpm --filter commercial-frontend-v2 dev
```

**After:**
```bash
pnpm --filter rbee-commercial-frontend dev
# or
cd frontend/bin/commercial-frontend
pnpm dev
```

### Start Comparison

```
stories/
├── Badge/           # Old v1
├── Button/          # Old v1
├── Carousel/        # Old v1
├── atoms/           # New structure
├── molecules/       # New structure
└── organisms/       # New structure
```

**After:** Clean atomic structure
```
stories/
├── atoms/           # 49 components
├── molecules/       # 14 components
└── organisms/       # 65 components
```

**Total:** 128 components (all scaffolded)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Reinstall Dependencies

```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch
pnpm install
```

This will update the workspace links.

### 2. Test Everything Works

```bash
# Test React reference
pnpm --filter frontend/reference/v0 dev

# Test Storybook
pnpm --filter orchyra-storybook story:dev

# Test Vue frontend
pnpm --filter rbee-commercial-frontend dev
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
./frontend/start-comparison.sh
```

## 📝 Notes

### Old Components Will Be Reimplemented

The 7 removed components will be reimplemented as atoms:
- Badge → atoms/Badge (already scaffolded)
- Button → atoms/Button (already scaffolded - needs implementation)
- Carousel → atoms/Carousel (already scaffolded)
- Drawer → atoms/Drawer (already scaffolded)

The old implementations were from v1 and not following the atomic design pattern.

### No Data Loss

All old code was removed, but:
- ✅ React reference still exists for porting
- ✅ All new scaffolding is in place
- ✅ Documentation is complete

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Removed:**
- Old commercial-frontend (v1)
- 7 old storybook components
- All v2 references

**Result:**
- ✅ Clean structure
- ✅ Single commercial frontend (Vue 3)
- ✅ 128 scaffolded components
- ✅ Ready for implementation
