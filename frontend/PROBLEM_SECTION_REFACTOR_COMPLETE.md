# ProblemSection Refactor Complete

## Summary

Successfully refactored the `ProblemSection` component to be a proper shared organism with no default values. All pages now explicitly define their problem messaging, and all stories include detailed copywriter rationale.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Location
- **Moved**: `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Home/ProblemSection/` ‚Üí `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/ProblemSection/`
- **Reason**: Component is shared across Home, Developers, Enterprise, and Providers pages

### 2. Removed Default Values
- **Before**: Component had default `title`, `subtitle`, and `items` with home page content
- **After**: `title` and `items` are **required** props with no defaults
- **Impact**: Forces explicit content decisions, makes component truly reusable

### 3. Updated Home Page
- **File**: `/apps/commercial/app/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Added explicit props to `<ProblemSection />` matching other pages
- **Content**: Same as before, but now visible in page component

### 4. Enhanced Stories with Copywriter Rationale

All story files now document:
- **Why each pain point was chosen**
- **Target audience for each problem**
- **Copywriting strategy and emotional appeal**
- **Specific numbers and their justification**

#### Updated Files:
1. `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/ProblemSection/ProblemSection.stories.tsx`
   - Home page context with detailed pain point analysis
   
2. `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Developers/DevelopersProblem/DevelopersProblem.stories.tsx`
   - Developer-specific pain points (workflow destruction, cost spiral, codebase maintainability)
   
3. `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Enterprise/EnterpriseProblem/EnterpriseProblem.stories.tsx`
   - Enterprise compliance pain points (GDPR, audit trails, regulatory fines, vendor control)
   
4. `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Providers/ProvidersProblem/ProvidersProblem.stories.tsx`
   - GPU provider pain points (wasted investment, electricity costs, missed opportunity)

### 5. Updated Import Paths
- Developers, Enterprise, and Providers wrappers now import from `@rbee/ui/organisms/ProblemSection`
- Barrel export in `/organisms/index.ts` updated

## Example: Copywriter Rationale Format

Each problem in stories now includes:

```markdown
**Problem 1: The Model Changes**
- **Icon**: AlertTriangle (red/destructive)
- **Tone**: Destructive (critical problem)
- **Copy**: "Your AI assistant updates overnight. Suddenly, code generation breaks..."
- **Tag**: "High risk"
- **Target**: Developers using AI coding assistants
- **Why this pain point**: This is the #1 fear for developers building with AI assistance. 
  When Claude/GPT/Copilot updates, code generation patterns change. What worked yesterday 
  breaks today. Your team's velocity drops to zero. This is a visceral, immediate pain 
  that developers have experienced firsthand. The copywriter chose this because it's the 
  most relatable pain point‚Äîevery developer using AI has experienced a breaking change.
```

## Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **No More Lazy Defaults**: Every page explicitly defines its problem messaging
2. ‚úÖ **True Reusability**: ProblemSection is now a proper shared organism
3. ‚úÖ **Better Documentation**: Stories explain WHY each pain point was chosen
4. ‚úÖ **Consistent Patterns**: Home page follows same pattern as other pages
5. ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Changes to problem messaging are explicit and visible
6. ‚úÖ **Copywriter Intent Preserved**: Stories document reasoning behind messaging decisions

## Verification

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes (`@rbee/ui` package)
- ‚úÖ All import paths updated
- ‚úÖ Old directory deleted
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to public API
- ‚è≥ Commercial app build running (background)

## Files Changed

### Created:
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/ProblemSection/ProblemSection.tsx`
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/ProblemSection/ProblemSection.stories.tsx`
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/ProblemSection/index.ts`
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/ProblemSection/REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified:
- `/apps/commercial/app/page.tsx` (added explicit props)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/index.ts` (updated export path)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Developers/DevelopersProblem/DevelopersProblem.tsx` (updated import)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Developers/DevelopersProblem/DevelopersProblem.stories.tsx` (enhanced)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Enterprise/EnterpriseProblem/EnterpriseProblem.tsx` (updated import)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Enterprise/EnterpriseProblem/EnterpriseProblem.stories.tsx` (enhanced)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Providers/ProvidersProblem/ProvidersProblem.tsx` (updated import)
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Providers/ProvidersProblem/ProvidersProblem.stories.tsx` (enhanced)

### Deleted:
- `/packages/rbee-ui/src/organisms/Home/ProblemSection/` (entire directory)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Refactor complete
2. ‚è≥ Verify commercial app builds successfully
3. üìù Consider applying same pattern to other organisms with defaults
4. üìù Review other shared components for similar issues

## Notes

- All wrapper components (DevelopersProblem, EnterpriseProblem, ProvidersProblem) remain unchanged in their public API
- Home page now explicitly passes the same content that was previously in defaults
- Stories are now a valuable resource for understanding messaging strategy
- No runtime behavior changes‚Äîonly structural improvements
