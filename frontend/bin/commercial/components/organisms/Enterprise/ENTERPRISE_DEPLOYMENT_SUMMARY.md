# Enterprise Deployment — Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** 2025-10-13

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Created StepCard Molecule

**File:** `components/molecules/StepCard/StepCard.tsx`

Reusable molecule for deployment steps:
- Numbered badge with connector line
- Icon + title header
- Tightened intro paragraph
- Check items in semantic `<ul>`
- Optional footnote
- Animation support via CSS variables
- Props: `index`, `icon`, `title`, `intro`, `items`, `footnote`, `isLast`, `className`

### 2. Redesigned EnterpriseHowItWorks

**File:** `enterprise-how-it-works.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added section semantics (`id="deployment"`, `aria-labelledby="deploy-h2"`)
- Added eyebrow kicker: "Deployment & Compliance"
- Tightened subcopy: "From consultation to production, we guide every step of your compliance journey"
- Replaced 4 inline step blocks with StepCard molecules
- Tightened all intro paragraphs (punchier, more scannable)
- Added decorative illustration (deployment-flow.webp)
- Converted timeline to sticky panel on right column
- Added progress bar to timeline
- Improved week chips with hover states

### 3. Grid Layout

**Old:** Single column with steps stacked, timeline at bottom  
**New:** Two-column grid on lg+
- Left: Steps rail (`<ol>` with StepCard instances)
- Right: Sticky timeline panel (`lg:sticky lg:top-24`)
- Grid: `lg:grid-cols-[1fr_360px] gap-10`

### 4. Content Refinements

**Intro paragraphs tightened:**
- Step 1: "We map requirements (GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), define residency, retention, and security controls."
- Step 2: "Deploy in EU data centers or on your servers. Configure EU-only workers, audit logging, and controls. White-label optional."
- Step 3: "Work with auditors: provide audit-trail access, docs, and architecture reviews. Supports SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR."
- Step 4: "Go live with enterprise SLAs, 24/7 support, monitoring, and compliance reporting. Scale as you grow."

**Deliverables:**
- Replaced bullet characters `•` with semantic `<li>` items
- Added check glyphs `✓` in `text-chart-3`

### 5. Sticky Timeline Panel

**Old:** Bottom card, centered, no sticky  
**New:**
- Position: `lg:sticky lg:top-24 lg:self-start`
- Card: `rounded-2xl border border-primary/20 bg-primary/5`
- Progress bar: Visual indicator (25% static)
- Week chips: `rounded-xl` with `hover:bg-secondary`
- Semantic: `<ol>` for week list

### 6. Connector Lines

Added visual continuity between steps:
- Vertical line: `absolute left-5 top-12 h-[calc(100%+2rem)] w-px bg-border`
- Hidden on last step via `isLast` prop

### 7. Motion Hierarchy

Staggered animations:
1. Header: 0ms (fade + slide up)
2. Steps: Staggered by index (0ms, 80ms, 160ms, 240ms)
3. Timeline: 200ms (fade + slide right)

All use `tw-animate-css`, respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 8. Accessibility Enhancements

- Section: `id="deployment"` + `aria-labelledby="deploy-h2"`
- H2: `id="deploy-h2"`
- Steps: `<ol>` with StepCard `<li role="group" aria-label="Step {index}: {title}">`
- Deliverables: `<ul role="list">` with `<li aria-label="Deliverable: {item}">`
- Timeline: `<ol role="list">` for week chips
- All icons: `aria-hidden="true"`
- Improved contrast: `text-foreground/85` (≥4.5:1)

### 9. Atomic Design Compliance

✅ **Molecules:** StepCard (new, reusable)  
✅ **Organism:** EnterpriseHowItWorks (redesigned)  
✅ **No duplication:** All steps use StepCard molecule

---

## Key Improvements

✅ **Scannable 4-step rail** — StepCard molecules with connector lines  
✅ **Sticky timeline** — Stays visible while reading steps  
✅ **Tightened copy** — Punchier intros, active verbs  
✅ **Semantic structure** — `<ol>` for steps, `<ul>` for deliverables  
✅ **Professional motion** — Staggered animations  
✅ **Stronger proof** — Progress bar, week chips, deliverables

## Files Modified

1. `enterprise-how-it-works.tsx` — Complete redesign
2. `molecules/index.ts` — Added StepCard export

## Files Created

1. `molecules/StepCard/StepCard.tsx` — New molecule
2. `public/decor/README-deployment-flow.md` — Asset spec
3. `ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT_REDESIGN.md` — Full docs
4. `ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` — This file

---

## Pending

1. **Asset:** Create `/public/decor/deployment-flow.webp` (1200×640px)
2. **Optional:** Make week chips interactive (scroll to step)
3. **Optional:** Animate progress bar based on scroll

---

## Result

A polished, accessible deployment flow that's easy to scan, visually connected, and conversion-ready—aligning with design tokens and atomic system while eliminating duplicated step markup.

**Conversion hypothesis:** Scannable steps + sticky timeline + tightened copy = higher engagement and demo requests.
