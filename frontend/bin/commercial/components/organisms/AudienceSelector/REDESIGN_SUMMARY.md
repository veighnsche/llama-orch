# AudienceSelector Redesign Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Component:** `organisms/AudienceSelector/AudienceSelector.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Transformed AudienceSelector into a confident, story-led "choose your path" section that clarifies the three journeys (Developers, GPU Owners, Enterprise) with strengthened visual hierarchy and brand expression.

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ 1. Layout Composition (Structure + Hierarchy)
- [x] Wrapped section in semantic `<header>` + grid structure
- [x] Reduced header max-width to `max-w-2xl` for crisper line lengths
- [x] Implemented responsive grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`
- [x] Applied `gap-6 xl:gap-8` spacing
- [x] Ensured equal height cards via `h-full` and `min-h-[22rem]`
- [x] Added subfooter with three inline CTA link pills
- [x] Implemented radial gradient backplate using semantic tokens
- [x] Enhanced top hairline with `via-primary/30` and backdrop blur

### ✅ 2. Header Block (Copy + Emphasis)
- [x] Eyebrow: "Choose your path" (all caps, kept)
- [x] Headline: "Where should you start?" (shorter, conversational)
- [x] Supporting copy: "rbee adapts to how you work—build on your own GPUs, monetize idle capacity, or deploy compliant AI at scale."

### ✅ 3. Card Content Upgrades
- [x] **Developers Card:**
  - Category: "For Developers"
  - Title: "Build on Your Hardware"
  - Description: "Power Zed, Cursor, and your own agents on YOUR GPUs. OpenAI-compatible—drop-in, zero API fees."
  - Features: Zero API costs, network privacy, Agentic API + TypeScript
  - Badge: "Homelab-ready" pill
  
- [x] **GPU Owners Card:**
  - Category: "For GPU Owners"
  - Title: "Monetize Your Hardware"
  - Description: "Join the rbee marketplace and earn from gaming rigs to server farms—set price, stay in control."
  - Features: Set pricing, audit trails, passive income
  
- [x] **Enterprise Card:**
  - Category: "For Enterprise"
  - Title: "Compliance & Security"
  - Description: "EU-native compliance, audit trails, and zero-trust architecture—from day one."
  - Features: GDPR 7-year retention, SOC2/ISO 27001, private cloud/on-prem

### ✅ 4. Decision Helper Strip
- [x] Replaced single sentence with 3-item decision strip
- [x] Inline at md+, stacked on mobile
- [x] Three link pills with badges and chevrons:
  - "Code with AI locally" → Developers
  - "Earn from idle GPUs" → GPU Owners
  - "Deploy with compliance" → Enterprise
- [x] Hover effects: `translate-y-[-2px]`

### ✅ 5. Purposeful Imagery
- [x] Created three brand-supporting SVG illustrations (96×96):
  - `dev-grid.svg`: Blueprint-style homelab with code windows
  - `gpu-market.svg`: Honeycomb marketplace grid
  - `compliance-shield.svg`: Golden shield with EU stars and audit logs
- [x] Integrated via Next.js `<Image>` component
- [x] Applied rounded containers with ring borders
- [x] Priority loading for first card

### ✅ 6. Motion Hierarchy
- [x] Header fade-up animation: `animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-400`
- [x] Card stagger: 0ms, 60ms, 120ms delays
- [x] Hover lift: `hover:-translate-y-1` with shadow
- [x] Motion-reduce fallback: `motion-reduce:animate-none`
- [x] Focus rings: `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary/40`

### ✅ 7. Accessibility Improvements
- [x] Proper heading structure: `<p>` eyebrow, `<h2>` title, `<h3>` card titles
- [x] Grid aria-label: "Audience options: Developers, GPU Owners, Enterprise"
- [x] Card buttons with `aria-describedby` pointing to description IDs
- [x] Icons marked with `aria-hidden="true"`
- [x] Semantic HTML throughout

### ✅ 8. Responsive & Density Rules
- [x] Vertical rhythm: `mb-10 sm:mb-12` on header
- [x] Card padding: `p-6 sm:p-7 lg:p-8`
- [x] Text sizing: `text-sm sm:text-base` for features
- [x] Equal column heights: `grid + content-start + min-h-[22rem]`

### ✅ 9. Color & Theming
- [x] Card accents: `chart-2` (Developers), `chart-3` (Providers), `primary` (Enterprise)
- [x] Semantic tokens: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`
- [x] Dark mode support via CSS variables

### ✅ 10. Copy Edits
- [x] Updated main supporting copy to confident, low-BS tone
- [x] No pronunciation guidance (saved for global hero/footer)

### ✅ 11. Reuse & Atomic Integrity
- [x] Reused existing `Button`, `Badge`, `Card` atoms
- [x] Extended `AudienceCard` molecule via props/slots (no fork)
- [x] Added `imageSlot` and `badgeSlot` optional props to molecule
- [x] Maintained organism structure (no template conversion)

### ✅ 12. Implementation Details

- [x] Adjusted grid breakpoints & equal heights
- [x] Injected `<Image>` blocks above titles
- [x] Updated feature bullets + CTAs
- [x] Added decision strip with link pills
- [x] Added motion classes + reduced-motion fallback

## Next Steps (Optional)

- [ ] Generate actual PNG/WebP illustrations from design team (replace SVG placeholders)
