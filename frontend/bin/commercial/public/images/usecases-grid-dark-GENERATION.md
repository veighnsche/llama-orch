## üöÄ Quick Start (Copy & Paste)

### Option 1: Midjourney (Recommended)

```
/imagine cinematic wide shot banner, three developer workstations in dark modern office, connected by glowing neon teal network lines forming mesh topology, LEFT: gaming PC tower with visible GPU through glass, CENTER: sleek workstation with dual monitors, RIGHT: Mac Studio compact setup, floating UI overlays showing "Private AI Cluster" and network metrics, dark navy background #0f172a, subtle depth of field, realistic studio lighting with teal rim lights, brand colors teal/blue/amber accents, conveys on-premises distributed AI infrastructure, professional photography aesthetic, 16:5 aspect ratio, 1920x640, --ar 16:5 --style raw --v 6
```

### Option 2: DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT Plus)

```
Create a cinematic wide banner (16:5 aspect ratio) showing a private AI cluster setup. THREE WORKSTATIONS: LEFT - gaming PC tower with visible NVIDIA GPU through tempered glass panel, CENTER - professional workstation with dual monitors displaying code, RIGHT - compact Mac Studio. NETWORK: Glowing neon teal lines (#14b8a6) connecting the three machines in a mesh pattern, floating above the desk surface. OVERLAYS: Subtle floating UI elements showing "Private AI Cluster", "8 GPUs", "0 external dependencies". BACKGROUND: Deep navy blue (#0f172a) with subtle gradient, professional studio lighting with teal rim lights on hardware. STYLE: Realistic photography with cinematic color grading, shallow depth of field, brand-safe professional aesthetic. 1920x640 pixels.
```

### Option 3: Stable Diffusion (ComfyUI/Automatic1111)

**Positive Prompt:**
```
cinematic wide banner 16:5, three developer workstations dark office, gaming PC tower visible GPU glass panel left, professional workstation dual monitors center, mac studio compact right, glowing neon teal network lines #14b8a6 connecting machines mesh topology, floating ui overlays private ai cluster network metrics, deep navy background #0f172a, subtle depth of field, realistic studio lighting teal rim lights, brand colors teal blue amber accents, on-premises distributed infrastructure, professional photography aesthetic, high detail hardware, 1920x640
```

**Negative Prompt:**
```
people, hands, faces, cluttered, messy cables, bright daylight, windows, RGB gaming lights, cartoon, low quality, blurry, text artifacts, watermark

## üìã Key Visual Elements

### Must Have:

1. ‚úÖ **Three workstations** (left to right):
   - **Gaming PC** (left): Tower with visible GPU through glass, amber LED accents
   - **Workstation** (center): Professional setup, dual monitors, code visible
   - **Mac Studio** (right): Compact, minimal, sleek design

2. ‚úÖ **Network visualization**:
   - Glowing neon teal lines (#14b8a6) connecting the three machines
   - Mesh topology (not star, not linear)
   - Lines float slightly above desk surface
   - Subtle data packet animations (optional)

3. ‚úÖ **Floating UI overlays**:
   - "Private AI Cluster" label
   - Network metrics: "8 GPUs", "3 nodes"
   - "0 external dependencies" or "$0/mo API costs"
   - Minimal, semi-transparent panels

4. ‚úÖ **Background & lighting**:
   - Deep navy blue (#0f172a)
   - Subtle gradient (darker at edges)
   - Studio lighting with teal rim lights on hardware
   - Shallow depth of field (hardware sharp, background soft)

5. ‚úÖ **Brand colors**:
   - Primary: Teal/cyan (#14b8a6)
   - Secondary: Amber (#f59e0b) for GPU accents
   - Accent: Blue (#3b82f6) for monitors
   - Background: Navy (#0f172a)

### Style:
- Realistic photography (not illustration)
- Cinematic color grading
- Professional studio aesthetic
- Shallow depth of field
- High detail on hardware
- Clean, minimal composition

## üìê Composition Guidelines

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:5 (wide banner, 1920√ó640)

**Rule of Thirds:**
- Left third: Gaming PC (most prominent hardware)
- Center third: Workstation (focal point, monitors)
- Right third: Mac Studio (compact, minimal)

**Depth Layers:**
1. Foreground: Desk surface (slightly out of focus)
2. Middle: Hardware (sharp focus)
3. Background: Navy gradient (soft bokeh)

**Visual Flow:**
Eyes should move: Gaming PC ‚Üí Workstation ‚Üí Mac Studio ‚Üí Network lines

## üì• After Generation

1. **Download** your generated image
2. **Resize** to exactly 1920√ó640 if needed
3. **Optimize** file size (keep under 200KB using TinyPNG.com or convert to WebP)
4. **Save as** `usecases-grid-dark.jpg` (or `.webp`)
5. **Place** at `/public/images/usecases-grid-dark.jpg`
6. **Update component** if using WebP extension

## üí° Tips

- **File size:** Keep under 200KB (use compression or WebP)
- **Format:** JPG preferred (better compression for photos), WebP for best quality/size
- **Quality:** High detail but web-optimized
- **Mood:** Professional, not gaming aesthetic
- **Focus:** Hardware should be sharp, background soft
- **Lighting:** Teal rim lights create brand cohesion
- **Clutter:** Minimal - only essential hardware visible

---

## üé¨ Reference Mood

Think: "Apple product photography meets cyberpunk network visualization"

**Inspiration:**
- Apple Mac Studio product shots (clean, minimal)
- Cisco network topology diagrams (but photoreal)
- Blade Runner 2049 tech scenes (teal/amber palette)
- Professional studio hardware photography

## üìñ Usage Context

This banner appears at the **top of the Use Cases section**, directly under the heading. It should visually communicate:

- ‚úÖ Distributed infrastructure (multiple machines)
- ‚úÖ Private network (no cloud, on-premises)
- ‚úÖ Professional setup (not amateur)
- ‚úÖ Brand identity (teal/navy palette)

**Status:** Awaiting image generation. Component will use this once placed.
