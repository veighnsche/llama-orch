# Component Migration - Final Status

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Completed
1. **All 150+ components migrated to @rbee/ui**
   - 74 atoms
   - 45+ molecules
   - 30+ organisms
   - 4 patterns

2. **Updated imports in @rbee/ui**
   - Changed `@/components/*` to `@rbee/ui/*` in 92 files
   - Changed `@/lib/utils` to `@rbee/ui/utils` in components

3. **Updated commercial site app pages**
   - All `app/**/*.tsx` files now import from `@rbee/ui`
   - Removed entire `components/` directory (except ThemeProvider)

4. **Created index files**
   - Added `index.ts` to all atom/molecule/organism folders
   - Configured package exports in `@rbee/ui/package.json`

### ⚠️ Current Issue

The site loads (DOCTYPE html) but renders blank. This indicates:
- Build succeeds
- No module resolution errors
- Likely runtime issue with component rendering

### Remaining Work

**33 files still have `@/` imports** that need fixing:
- These are likely imports to `@/lib/*`, `@/data/*`, or other non-component paths
- Need to either:
  1. Copy those utilities to `@rbee/ui`
  2. Keep them in commercial site and update imports
  3. Use relative imports within `@rbee/ui`

## Current Structure

```
frontend/bin/commercial/
├── app/                    # ✅ All imports from @rbee/ui
├── components/
│   └── providers/          # ✅ Only ThemeProvider (app-specific)
├── lib/                    # Still exists (utilities)
├── data/                   # Still exists (content)
└── hooks/                  # Still exists (app-specific)

frontend/libs/rbee-ui/
├── src/
│   ├── atoms/              # ✅ 74 components
│   ├── molecules/          # ✅ 45+ components
│   ├── organisms/          # ✅ 30+ components
│   ├── patterns/           # ✅ 4 components
│   ├── tokens/             # ✅ Design tokens
│   └── utils/              # ✅ cn() helper
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix remaining `@/` imports in @rbee/ui** (33 files)
   - Find what they import (`@/lib/utils`, `@/data/*`, etc.)
   - Decide: copy to @rbee/ui or use relative paths

2. **Test the site loads properly**
   - Verify all pages render
   - Check navigation works
   - Confirm no console errors

3. **Clean up**
   - Remove any unused files
   - Update documentation

## Progress

- ✅ Components migrated: 150+
- ✅ Import paths updated in @rbee/ui: 92 files
- ✅ App pages updated: All files
- ⚠️ Remaining imports to fix: 33 files
- ⚠️ Site rendering: Needs debugging

The migration is 90% complete. The remaining 10% is fixing the last 33 files with `@/` imports and debugging why the site renders blank.
