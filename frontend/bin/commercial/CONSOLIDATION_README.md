## Quick Start

This directory contains documentation for the commercial frontend consolidation project completed on 2025-10-13.

### For Developers

**Want to understand what was done?**  
→ Read [CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md](./CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md)

**Want full implementation details?**

## What Happened

We consolidated duplicate patterns in the commercial frontend by:

1. **Creating 2 new molecules**: StatsGrid, IconPlate
2. **Removing 3 old molecules**: StatCard, StatTile, StatInfoCard
3. **Adding 3 gradient utilities**: .bg-radial-glow, .bg-section-gradient, .bg-section-gradient-primary
4. **Migrating 22 files** to use the new molecules
5. **Saving ~370 lines** of code (10-12% reduction)

---

## Key Molecules

### StatsGrid
Unified stat displays with 4 variants (pills, tiles, cards, inline)

**Example**:
```tsx
<StatsGrid
  variant="pills"
  columns={3}
  stats={[
    { icon: <Icon />, value: '€50–200', label: 'per GPU / month' }
  ]}
/>
```

### IconPlate
Reusable icon containers with customizable size, tone, and shape.

**Example**:
```tsx
<IconPlate icon={<Shield />} size="lg" tone="primary" />
```

### Gradient Utilities
Consistent background gradients.

**Example**:
```tsx
<section className="bg-radial-glow">
```

## Files in This Directory

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONSOLIDATION_README.md` | This file - quick start guide |
| `MOLECULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` | Developer quick reference for using molecules |
| `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` | Executive summary of the consolidation |
| `CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md` | Full implementation details and metrics |
| `CONSOLIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` | Implementation checklist (all items complete) |

## What Was NOT Done

We intentionally avoided:

- ❌ **Hero consolidation** - Too unique, would create "wrapper hell"
- ❌ **CTA consolidation** - Different patterns, already using molecules
- ❌ **Animation delay normalization** - Low benefit for high effort

These decisions were made following the V2 investigation methodology, which prioritized conservative consolidation over aggressive refactoring.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Code reduction | 5-10% | 10-12% | ✅ |
| IconPlate adoption | 80% | 100% | ✅ |
| Gradient adoption | 50% | 56% | ✅ |
| Components removed | 0 | 3 | ✅ |
| TypeScript errors | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Visual regressions | 0 | 0 | ✅ |

## Next Steps

### For New Features
When building new components:

1. **Check if pattern exists** - Use StatsGrid for stats, IconPlate for icons
2. **Use gradient utilities** - Apply .bg-radial-glow instead of inline gradients
3. **Follow the guide** - See MOLECULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md for examples

### For Maintenance
When updating existing components:

1. **Consider migration** - If you see duplicate patterns, consider using molecules
2. **Don't over-consolidate** - Only consolidate if pattern repeats 10+ times
3. **Document new patterns** - If you create a new molecule, document it

## Questions?

**How do I use StatsGrid?**  
See [MOLECULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md](./MOLECULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md#statsgrid)

**How do I use IconPlate?**  
See [MOLECULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md](./MOLECULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md#iconplate)

**What files were changed?**  
See [CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md](./CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md#files-modified)

**Why weren't heroes consolidated?**  
See [CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md](./CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md#what-was-not-done-by-design)

## Cleanup

These files were deleted after implementation:
- ~~CONSOLIDATION_INVESTIGATION.md~~ (V1 - superseded)
- ~~CONSOLIDATION_INVESTIGATION_V2.md~~ (V2 - implemented)
- ~~StatCard~~ (replaced by StatsGrid)
- ~~StatTile~~ (replaced by StatsGrid)
- ~~StatInfoCard~~ (replaced by StatsGrid)

All recommendations from V2 have been implemented.
