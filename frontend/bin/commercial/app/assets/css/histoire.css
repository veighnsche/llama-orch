/* TEAM-DX-006: Histoire-specific CSS that imports pre-compiled Tailwind from storybook
 *
 * Bug: Commercial Histoire was missing CSS classes from rbee-storybook workspace dependency
 *      Example: cursor-pointer class existed in Button.vue but wasn't in compiled CSS
 *      Root cause: Tailwind v4 PostCSS plugin doesn't scan workspace dependencies properly
 *
 * Fix: Import the already-compiled CSS from storybook instead of trying to scan/compile
 *      Storybook's Tailwind already scans its own files and generates complete CSS
 *      This approach uses workspace package imports (rbee-storybook/...) not relative paths
 *
 * Expected: All Tailwind classes from storybook components now available in Histoire
 *           No duplicate Tailwind processing (Nuxt still uses @tailwindcss/vite for production)
 *           Hot reload works automatically when storybook CSS changes

@import "rbee-storybook/styles/tokens.css";
