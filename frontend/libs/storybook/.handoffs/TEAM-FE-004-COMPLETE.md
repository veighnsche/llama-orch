## 🎨 Design Token Usage

**Followed critical requirement:** Used design tokens instead of hardcoded colors.

**Translations Applied:**
- `bg-slate-950` → `bg-background`
- `bg-slate-900` → `bg-secondary`
- `text-white` → `text-foreground`
- `text-slate-400` → `text-muted-foreground`
- `text-amber-500` → `text-primary`
- `border-slate-800` → `border-border`

**Why this matters:** Enables dark mode, consistent branding, and easy theme changes.

## 🎯 Compliance with Engineering Rules

### Rule 1: Build in Storybook First ✅
- Both components built in storybook
- Stories created before any app integration
- Tested in Histoire

### Rule 2: Use Design Tokens ✅
- NO hardcoded colors (no bg-slate-950, text-amber-500, etc.)
- Used semantic tokens (bg-background, text-primary, etc.)
- Followed translation guide from 00-DESIGN-TOKENS-CRITICAL.md

### Rule 3: Histoire Story Format ✅
- Used .story.vue format (NOT .story.ts)
- Deleted old .story.ts files
- Stories use <Story> and <Variant> components

### Rule 4: Export Components ✅
- Tabs + 3 subcomponents exported in index.ts
- AudienceSelector already exported (was scaffolded)

### Rule 5: Team Signatures ✅
- Added "TEAM-FE-004" signature to all files
- Kept original "TEAM-FE-000 (Scaffolding)" signatures

### Rule 6: No TODO Comments ✅
- Removed all TODO comments from implemented files
- Completed all scaffolded sections

### Rule 7: Atomic Design ✅
- Tabs = Atom (uses Radix Vue primitives)
- AudienceSelector = Organism (uses Card + Button atoms)
- Proper hierarchy maintained

## 🚀 Next Steps for TEAM-FE-005

**Next Unit:** `01-05-SolutionSection.md`

**Location:** `/frontend/.plan/01-05-SolutionSection.md`

**What to do:**
1. Read the unit file
2. Read React reference: `/frontend/reference/v0/app/page.tsx` (find SolutionSection)
3. Implement in: `/frontend/libs/storybook/stories/organisms/SolutionSection/`
4. Create .story.vue file
5. Test in Histoire
6. Continue with remaining Home Page units

**Pattern to follow:** Same as AudienceSelector
- Use design tokens
- Create .story.vue (not .story.ts)
- Add team signature
- Export in index.ts
- Test in Histoire

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Tabs was scaffolded but not implemented** - Completed it as a bonus since it was needed
2. **AudienceSelector doesn't actually use Tabs** - It's a card grid, not tabs
3. **Design token translation is critical** - Followed guide exactly
4. **Radix Vue subcomponents** - Need separate files for TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent
5. **Linting catches unused variables** - Fixed by removing unused `props` assignment
