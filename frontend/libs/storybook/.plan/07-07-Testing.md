## üìö Required Reading

**BEFORE starting this unit, read:**

1. **Design Tokens (CRITICAL):** `00-DESIGN-TOKENS-CRITICAL.md`
   - DO NOT copy colors from React reference
   - Use design tokens: `bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.
   - Translation guide: React colors ‚Üí Vue tokens

2. **Engineering Rules:** `/frontend/FRONTEND_ENGINEERING_RULES.md`
   - Section 2: Design tokens requirement
   - Section 3: Histoire `.story.vue` format
   - Section 8: Port vs create distinction

3. **Examples:** Look at completed components
   - HeroSection: `/frontend/libs/storybook/stories/organisms/HeroSection/`
   - WhatIsRbee: `/frontend/libs/storybook/stories/organisms/WhatIsRbee/`
   - ProblemSection: `/frontend/libs/storybook/stories/organisms/ProblemSection/`

**Key Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Use `.story.vue` format (NOT `.story.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Use design tokens (NOT hardcoded colors like `bg-amber-500`)
- ‚úÖ Import from workspace: `import { Button } from 'rbee-storybook/stories'`
- ‚úÖ Add team signature: `<!-- TEAM-FE-XXX: Implemented ComponentName -->`
- ‚úÖ Export in `stories/index.ts`
