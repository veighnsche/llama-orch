# 📋 HANDOFF SUMMARY - Story Variants Enhancement

**From:** TEAM-FE-008  
**To:** Next Team  
**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** Ready for Handoff

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

All 20 components (Enterprise + Features pages) have been implemented with full functionality, but their `.story.vue` files only contain the "Default" variant. The next team needs to enhance these story files with 2-4 variants each to demonstrate different prop configurations.

---

## 📦 What's Complete

✅ **20 Vue Components** - Fully implemented with TypeScript, design tokens, responsive design  
✅ **20 Story Files** - Exist with basic "Default" variant  
✅ **All Exports** - Components exported in `index.ts`  
✅ **All Props** - Components have proper TypeScript interfaces with defaults

---

## 📝 What's Needed

🔲 **Story Variants** - Add 2-4 variants per component showing:
- Different prop values
- Optional features toggled on/off
- Custom content examples
- Edge cases (where applicable)

---

## 📚 Documentation

**Main Handoff Document:** `HANDOFF_STORY_VARIANTS.md`

This document contains:
- Complete list of all 20 components
- Suggested variants for each component

## 🎨 Pattern Example

**Before (Current):**
```vue
<Story title="organisms/ComponentName">
  <Variant title="Default">
    <ComponentName />
  </Variant>

```vue
<Story title="organisms/ComponentName">
  <Variant title="Default">
    <ComponentName />
  </Variant>

  <Variant title="Custom Props">
    <ComponentName
      title="Custom Title"
      :some-prop="false"
    />
  </Variant>

  <Variant title="Minimal">
    <ComponentName :show-optional="false" />
  </Variant>
</Story>
```
