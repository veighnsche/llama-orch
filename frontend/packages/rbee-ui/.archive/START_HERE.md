## üéØ THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

### Issue #1: Viewport Stories Are Garbage

Looking at your screenshot:
```
FAQSection/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mobile View    ‚Üê DELETE - Just use viewport toolbar!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tablet View    ‚Üê DELETE - Just use viewport toolbar!
```

These stories provide ZERO value. Users can click the viewport button in Storybook to see mobile/tablet. **TEAM-001 deletes all of these.**

### Issue #2: No Marketing Documentation

Existing stories show the component but don't document:
- ‚ùå WHO is the target audience?
- ‚ùå WHAT is the messaging strategy?
- ‚ùå WHY this headline vs. another?
- ‚ùå HOW do CTAs drive conversion?

**TEAMS 2-5 add complete marketing documentation to every organism.**

### Issue #3: 50+ Missing Stories

Discovered 52 organisms used in commercial site that have NO stories at all:
- Developers page: 7 organisms
- Enterprise page: 11 organisms
- Features page: 9 organisms
- Providers page: 10 organisms
- Use Cases page: 3 organisms
- Home page: 5 organisms (+ 7 needing enhancement)

**TEAMS 2-5 create complete stories for all missing organisms.**

## üöÄ HOW TO START

### Option A: Run Teams Sequentially (One Person/Agent)

**Best for:** Single developer or single AI agent

**Timeline:** 13-17 weeks total

**Steps:**
1. Week 1: Run TEAM-001 (cleanup)
2. Weeks 2-3: Run TEAM-002 (home page)
3. Weeks 4-6: Run TEAM-003 (developers/features)
4. Weeks 7-9: Run TEAM-004 (enterprise/pricing)
5. Weeks 10-12: Run TEAM-005 (providers/use cases)
6. Week 13: Run TEAM-006 (atoms/molecules)

**Commands:**
```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/frontend/packages/rbee-ui

# Start Storybook (keep running)
pnpm storybook

# Read team document
cat TEAM_001_CLEANUP_VIEWPORT_STORIES.md

# Execute team mission
# ... do the work ...

# Mark complete in team document
# Move to next team
```

---

### Option B: Run Teams in Parallel (Multiple People/Agents)

**Best for:** Team of developers or multiple AI agents

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks total

**Steps:**

**Week 1, Days 1-2: TEAM-001 ONLY (BLOCKING)**
- One person/agent runs TEAM-001
- Others wait or read their team documents

**Week 1, Day 3 onwards: ALL OTHER TEAMS START**
- TEAM-002 starts
- TEAM-003 starts
- TEAM-004 starts
- TEAM-005 starts
- TEAM-006 starts (can start anytime)

**Weeks 2-3: Continue in Parallel**
- All teams work simultaneously
- Coordinate on overlapping components
- Update progress in team documents

**Week 4: QA and Final Touches**
- Test all stories
- Fix any issues
- Final documentation review

**Coordination:**
- Use team documents to communicate progress
- Note any blockers or questions in team docs
- Check for overlapping components (TEAM-002 and TEAM-003, TEAM-003 and TEAM-006)

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (2-3 People/Agents)

**Best for:** Small team

**Timeline:** 5-7 weeks total

**Steps:**
1. Week 1: Run TEAM-001 (cleanup)
2. Weeks 2-3: Run TEAM-002 + TEAM-006 in parallel
3. Weeks 3-4: Run TEAM-003 + TEAM-004 in parallel
4. Weeks 5-6: Run TEAM-005
5. Week 7: QA

## üö® CRITICAL RULES (ALL TEAMS)

### ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:
1. Create MobileView/TabletView stories (use viewport toolbar)
2. Use Lorem ipsum or placeholder text
3. Skip marketing documentation
4. Create only Default story (minimum 3 required)
5. Ignore the actual page copy (must match real usage)

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS:
1. Read the actual page first (`frontend/apps/commercial/app/[page]/page.tsx`)
2. Document marketing strategy (audience, message, CTAs)
3. Show real variants (different headlines, focus areas)
4. Test in light AND dark mode
5. Commit per component with descriptive messages

## üìû QUESTIONS?

**Q: Can I skip TEAM-001 and start my team?**  
A: NO. TEAM-001 must complete first. Other teams will conflict with cleanup.

**Q: How do I know if my team's work overlaps with another team?**  
A: Read the coordination section in your team document and `STORYBOOK_TEAM_MASTER_PLAN.md`.

**Q: What if I find a component that's not in my scope?**  
A: Note it in your team document. Don't do work outside your scope without coordination.

**Q: How do I document marketing strategy?**  
A: See examples in team documents. Template provided in `STORYBOOK_DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`.

**Q: What if the component is used differently across multiple pages?**  
A: Create separate stories for each usage context. Example: PricingSection has HomePageContext and PricingPageContext stories.
