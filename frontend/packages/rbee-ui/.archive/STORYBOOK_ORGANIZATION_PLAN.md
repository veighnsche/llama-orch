# üóÇÔ∏è STORYBOOK ORGANIZATION PLAN

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE  
**Goal:** Organize scattered components into logical groups

---

## üéØ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### Problem 1: Icons Scattered Everywhere
**Current state:**
- `src/atoms/GitHubIcon/` - Atom with stories
- `src/atoms/DiscordIcon/` - Atom with stories
- `src/atoms/XTwitterIcon/` - Atom with stories
- `src/atoms/StarIcon/` - Atom (rating star)
- `src/icons/GithubIcon.tsx` - Duplicate implementation
- `src/icons/DiscordIcon.tsx` - Duplicate implementation
- `src/icons/XTwitterIcon.tsx` - Duplicate implementation
- `src/icons/Icons.stories.tsx` - Separate stories file

**Issues:**
- Social media icons duplicated in two places
- IconButton mixed with social icons
- StarIcon (UI component) mixed with brand icons

---

### Problem 2: Page Organisms Not Consistently Grouped
**Current state:**

**‚úÖ Well organized (keep as-is):**
- `organisms/Enterprise/` - All enterprise page organisms grouped
- `organisms/Developers/` - All developer page organisms grouped

**‚ùå Scattered in root:**
- `organisms/HeroSection/` - Home page hero
- `organisms/FaqSection/` - Home page FAQ
- `organisms/PricingSection/` - Home page pricing
- `organisms/SolutionSection/` - Home page solution
- `organisms/ProblemSection/` - Home page problem
- `organisms/StepsSection/` - Home page steps
- `organisms/TechnicalSection/` - Home page technical
- `organisms/SocialProofSection/` - Home page social proof
- `organisms/TestimonialsRail/` - Home page testimonials
- `organisms/TopologyDiagram/` - Home page topology
- `organisms/WhatIsRbee/` - Home page what is rbee
- `organisms/HowItWorksSection/` - Home page how it works
- `organisms/FeaturesSection/` - Home page features
- `organisms/FeatureTabsSection/` - Home page feature tabs
- `organisms/CodeExamplesSection/` - Home page code examples
- `organisms/ComparisonSection/` - Home page comparison
- `organisms/CtaSection/` - Home page CTA
- `organisms/EmailCapture/` - Home page email capture
- `organisms/Navigation/` - Shared navigation
- `organisms/Footer/` - Shared footer

**‚ùå Page folders with mixed content:**
- `organisms/Providers/` - Provider page organisms (should be grouped like Enterprise)
- `organisms/UseCases/` - Use cases page organisms (should be grouped like Enterprise)
- `organisms/Pricing/` - Pricing page organisms (separate from PricingSection)
- `organisms/Features/` - Features page organisms (separate from FeaturesSection)
- `organisms/AudienceSelector/` - Belongs to which page?
- `organisms/UseCasesSection/` - Different from UseCases?

**Issues:**
- Home page organisms scattered in root (should be in `organisms/Home/`)
- Multiple pages have similar naming (Pricing/PricingSection, Features/FeaturesSection, UseCases/UseCasesSection)
- Shared components (Navigation, Footer) mixed with page-specific ones

---

### Problem 3: Table/Comparison Molecules Scattered
**Current state:**
- `molecules/ComparisonTableRow/` - Used in comparison tables
- `molecules/MatrixTable/` - Matrix table component
- `molecules/MatrixCard/` - Matrix card component
- `molecules/CheckListItem/` - Checklist item (table-related)
- Related to: `organisms/ComparisonSection/`

**Issues:**
- Table-related molecules not grouped together
- Hard to find all table components

---

### Problem 4: Other Scattered Molecules
**Current state:**
- **Enterprise-specific molecules scattered:**
  - `molecules/ComplianceChip/` - Enterprise only
  - `molecules/CompliancePillar/` - Enterprise only
  - `molecules/SecurityCrate/` - Enterprise only
  - `molecules/SecurityCrateCard/` - Enterprise only
  - `molecules/CTAOptionCard/` - Enterprise only
  
- **Pricing-specific molecules scattered:**
  - `molecules/PricingTier/` - Pricing only
  - `molecules/CheckListItem/` - Pricing features
  
- **Use case molecules scattered:**
  - `molecules/UseCaseCard/` - Use cases page
  - `molecules/IndustryCard/` - Use cases page
  - `molecules/IndustryCaseCard/` - Use cases page
  
- **Provider-specific molecules scattered:**
  - `molecules/EarningsCard/` - Providers page
  - `molecules/GPUListItem/` - Providers page

**Issues:**
- Page-specific molecules mixed with shared molecules
- Hard to find which molecules belong to which page

## üö® BREAKING CHANGES

### Import Path Changes
All imports will need to be updated:

**Before:**
```tsx
import { GitHubIcon } from '@rbee/ui/atoms/GitHubIcon'
import { HeroSection } from '@rbee/ui/organisms/HeroSection'
import { ComplianceChip } from '@rbee/ui/molecules/ComplianceChip'
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { GitHubIcon } from '@rbee/ui/atoms/Icons/BrandIcons/GitHubIcon'
import { HeroSection } from '@rbee/ui/organisms/Home/HeroSection'
import { ComplianceChip } from '@rbee/ui/molecules/Enterprise/ComplianceChip'
```

### Storybook Path Changes
All Storybook titles will change:

**Before:**
- `Atoms/Icons/GitHubIcon`
- `Organisms/HeroSection`
- `Molecules/ComplianceChip`

**After:**
- `Atoms/Icons/Brand/GitHubIcon`
- `Organisms/Home/HeroSection`
- `Molecules/Enterprise/ComplianceChip`

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After each phase:
- [ ] Storybook builds without errors
- [ ] All stories render correctly
- [ ] No broken imports
- [ ] No missing components
- [ ] Storybook navigation reflects new structure

---

## üéØ EXPECTED BENEFITS

### For Developers:
- ‚úÖ Easier to find related components
- ‚úÖ Clear component ownership (which page uses what)
- ‚úÖ Logical folder structure matches mental model
- ‚úÖ No more duplicate icons

### For Storybook Users:
- ‚úÖ Clear navigation by page/feature
- ‚úÖ Related components grouped together
- ‚úÖ Easier to find the right component
- ‚úÖ Better discoverability

### For Maintenance:
- ‚úÖ Easier to refactor page-specific components
- ‚úÖ Clear boundaries between shared and page-specific
- ‚úÖ Easier to delete unused components
- ‚úÖ Better organization for future growth

## ü§î DECISION NEEDED

**Should we proceed with all 3 strategies or prioritize?**

**Option A: All at once (RECOMMENDED)**
- Do all 3 phases in one go
- Biggest disruption but cleanest result
- ~6-8 hours of work

**Option B: Phased approach**
- Phase 1: Icons (least disruptive)
- Phase 2: Organisms (medium disruption)
- Phase 3: Molecules (most disruptive)
- Allows testing between phases

**Option C: Critical only**
- Only fix icons (most obvious duplication)
- Only group Home page organisms
- Leave molecules as-is for now

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Option A - All at once**

Reasons:
1. Import paths will break anyway, might as well fix everything
2. Cleaner result
3. Easier to communicate "we reorganized everything" than "we're reorganizing in phases"
4. Less confusion about "old vs new" structure
