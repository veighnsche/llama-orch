## üìñ HOW TO START

### Step 1: Choose Your Team
Pick one of the 8 teams based on priority:

**Highest Priority:**
- TEAM-007 (critical atoms A) - Badge, Card, Separator, Tabs, Input
- TEAM-008 (critical atoms B) - CodeSnippet, IconButton, Label, Progress
- TEAM-009 (critical molecules A) - SectionContainer, StatsGrid, IconBox
- TEAM-010 (critical molecules B) - CTAOptionCard, PricingTier, FeatureCard

**Medium Priority:**
- TEAM-011 (UI library A) - Alert, Dialog, Calendar, Carousel
- TEAM-012 (UI library B) - DropdownMenu, Form, Pagination, Popover
- TEAM-013 (UI library C) - Table, Toast, Switch, Skeleton

**Lower Priority:**
- TEAM-014 (supporting) - ArchitectureDiagram, StepCard, MatrixTable

---

### Step 2: Read Your Team Document

```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/frontend/packages/rbee-ui

# Read your team document
cat TEAM_007_CRITICAL_ATOMS_A.md
# or
cat TEAM_008_CRITICAL_ATOMS_B.md
# etc.
```

---

### Step 3: Start Storybook

```bash
pnpm storybook
# Opens at http://localhost:6006
```

---

### Step 4: Execute Your Mission

**For EACH component in your team:**
1. Create story file: `src/atoms/ComponentName/ComponentName.stories.tsx`
2. Create minimum 4 stories (Default, AllSizes, AllVariants, InContext)
3. Document all props in argTypes
4. Test in Storybook (light + dark mode)
5. Commit with descriptive message

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create story file
touch src/atoms/Badge/Badge.stories.tsx

# 2. Write stories (see examples in existing stories)

# 3. Test in Storybook
# Navigate to http://localhost:6006 and verify

# 4. Commit
git add src/atoms/Badge/Badge.stories.tsx
git commit -m "docs(storybook): create Badge atom story

- Added 4 stories: Default, AllVariants, AllSizes, InOrganisms
- Documented all props in argTypes
- Used in 30+ organisms"
```

---

### Step 5: Update Progress

Check off components in your team document as you complete them:
```markdown
- [x] Badge ‚úÖ
- [x] Card ‚úÖ
- [ ] Separator
```

---

### Step 6: Mark Complete

When ALL components in your team are done:
```markdown
**STATUS:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**START TIME:** 2025-10-15 09:00
**END TIME:** 2025-10-15 13:30
```

---

## ‚úÖ STORY REQUIREMENTS

### For EVERY Atom:
```typescript
// Minimum 4 stories
export const Default: Story = {}
export const AllSizes: Story = {} // sm, md, lg, xl
export const AllVariants: Story = {} // primary, secondary, destructive, etc.
export const InContext: Story = {} // Show usage in organism
```

### For EVERY Molecule:
```typescript
// Minimum 3-4 stories
export const Default: Story = {}
export const Variant1: Story = {}
export const Variant2: Story = {}
export const UsageContext: Story = {} // Show how organisms use it
```

### Documentation Required:
```markdown
## Overview
[What is this component?]

## Composition (for molecules)
- Built from: [List atoms used]

## When to Use
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

## Used In
- [Organism 1]
- [Organism 2]

## Props
[Document all props in argTypes]
```

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Create 3-4 REAL stories per component
- Document ALL props in argTypes
- Show ALL size/color/state variants
- Document which organisms use it
- Test in light AND dark mode

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Create MobileView/TabletView stories (use viewport toolbar)
- Create fake variants just to inflate numbers
- Skip prop documentation
- Leave console errors

## üéØ RECOMMENDED EXECUTION ORDER

### If You're Starting Fresh:
1. **TEAM-007** (critical atoms A) - Most used atoms
2. **TEAM-008** (critical atoms B) - More critical atoms

4. **TEAM-010** (critical molecules B) - More critical molecules
5. **TEAM-011** (UI library A) - Complete atom library
6. **TEAM-012** (UI library B) - Continue atom library
7. **TEAM-013** (UI library C) - Finish atom library
8. **TEAM-014** (supporting) - Complete molecule library

### If You're Prioritizing Impact:
1. **TEAM-007 + TEAM-009** (critical atoms A + molecules A)
2. **TEAM-008 + TEAM-010** (critical atoms B + molecules B)
3. Rest as needed

## üìû QUESTIONS?

**Q: Where do I start?**  
A: Read this file, choose a team (start with TEAM-007), read that team's document, start creating stories.

**Q: How do I know what stories to create?**  
A: Each team document lists the exact stories needed for each component. Minimum 3-4 per component.

**Q: What if I don't understand a component?**  
A: Check if it's used in organisms (team doc lists usage), look at the component code, or create basic stories showing all props.

**Q: Can I skip the UI library atoms (Teams 11-13)?**  
A: Yes, if prioritizing. Do Teams 7-10 first (critical components actively used).

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: 39-47 hours total for all 8 teams. 4-7 hours per team.

## üöÄ YOUR NEXT ACTION

**Choose your path:**

### Path 1: I'm Running This Solo
```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/frontend/packages/rbee-ui
cat TEAM_007_CRITICAL_ATOMS_A.md
pnpm storybook
# Start creating stories for Badge, Card, Separator, etc.
```

### Path 2: I'm Coordinating Multiple Teams
```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/frontend/packages/rbee-ui
cat COMPLETE_TEAM_SUMMARY.md  # See all 14 teams
# Assign teams 7-14 to people/bots
# Each reads their TEAM_00X document
# All start in parallel or phased
```

### Path 3: I Just Want to Understand
```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/frontend/packages/rbee-ui
cat START_HERE_ATOMS_MOLECULES.md  # This file
cat ATOMS_MOLECULES_MASTER_PLAN.md  # Complete overview
# Now you understand the system!
```
