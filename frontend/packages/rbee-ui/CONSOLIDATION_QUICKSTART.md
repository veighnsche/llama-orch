# Component Consolidation - Quick Start

**Status:** ✅ Ready to Execute  
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Teams:** 3 balanced teams  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours per team

---

## 🎯 What We're Doing

Consolidating **6 duplicate components** to create a single source of truth.

---

## 📋 Team Assignments (Balanced)

### TEAM-A: Structural + Pattern
- **Card** (atoms ← molecules) - Add forwardRef, merge stories
- **BeeGlyph** (patterns ← icons) - Update barrel export

**Complexity:** Medium | **Time:** 2-3h | **Files:** 4 modified, 3 deleted

---

### TEAM-B: Pattern + Brand Icon
- **HoneycombPattern** (patterns ← icons) - Update barrel export + imports
- **DiscordIcon** (icons ← atoms) - Consolidate, update Footer

**Complexity:** Medium | **Time:** 2-3h | **Files:** 5 modified, 2 deleted

---

### TEAM-C: Brand Icons (2×)
- **GitHubIcon** (icons ← atoms) - Rename, consolidate, update 3 organisms
- **XTwitterIcon** (icons ← atoms) - Consolidate, update Footer

**Complexity:** Medium | **Time:** 2-3h | **Files:** 8 modified, 2 deleted

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Read Documentation
Each team should read:
1. **`COMPONENT_CONSOLIDATION_RESEARCH.md`** - Understand what duplicates exist and why
2. **`TEAM_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`** - Find your team section with detailed steps

### Step 2: Create Working Branch
```bash
git checkout -b consolidate-components-TEAM-X
```

### Step 3: Follow Your Team Checklist
- Work through each checkbox in your team section
- Mark items complete as you go
- Test after each component

### Step 4: Verify
```bash
# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Build (optional but recommended)
pnpm build

# Storybook (verify stories work)
pnpm storybook
```

### Step 5: Document Completion
Create `TEAM_X_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md` with:
- Components consolidated
- Files modified/deleted
- Import updates made
- Verification results

## 📊 Quick Reference

### Files to Delete (by team)

**TEAM-A:**
- `src/molecules/Layout/Card.tsx`
- `src/molecules/Layout/Card.stories.tsx` (after merging)
- `src/icons/BeeGlyph.tsx`

**TEAM-B:**
- `src/icons/HoneycombPattern.tsx`
- `src/atoms/Icons/BrandIcons/DiscordIcon/` (entire directory)

**TEAM-C:**
- `src/atoms/Icons/BrandIcons/GitHubIcon/` (entire directory)
- `src/atoms/Icons/BrandIcons/XTwitterIcon/` (entire directory)

### Import Changes (by team)

**TEAM-A:**
- None (all internal to component files)

**TEAM-B:**
- `organisms/Features/FeaturesHero/FeaturesHero.tsx`
- `organisms/Home/HeroSection/HeroSection.tsx`
- `organisms/Shared/Footer/Footer.tsx`

**TEAM-C:**
- `organisms/Shared/Navigation/Navigation.tsx`
- `organisms/Shared/Footer/Footer.tsx` (2 icons)
- `organisms/Home/TechnicalSection/TechnicalSection.tsx`

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

### DO
✅ Add forwardRef + displayName to components  
✅ Merge story files (don't delete unique stories)  
✅ Update barrel exports to maintain compatibility  
✅ Test after each consolidation  
✅ Preserve all existing functionality  
✅ Keep TEAM-XXX signatures in code

### DON'T
❌ Remove external imports without updating them  
❌ Delete stories without merging them first  
❌ Break barrel export compatibility  
❌ Change component APIs (breaking changes)  
❌ Touch UseCasesHero (NOT a duplicate)  
❌ Remove other team signatures from code

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After consolidation, verify:

### TypeScript
```bash
pnpm typecheck
# Expected: 0 errors (same as before)
```

### Storybook
```bash
pnpm storybook
# Check: All stories render without errors
```

### Visual Check
- [ ] Card stories show all variants
- [ ] Icon stories show all brand icons
- [ ] Pattern components render correctly
- [ ] No console errors

### Import Tests
```typescript
// These should all work:
import { Card } from '@rbee/ui/atoms'
import { BeeGlyph, HoneycombPattern } from '@rbee/ui/icons'
import { GitHubIcon, DiscordIcon, XTwitterIcon } from '@rbee/ui/icons'
```

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Before
- 6 duplicate components
- 171 story files
- Inconsistent APIs (size prop vs className)
- 2 separate icon directories

### After
- 6 consolidated components
- ~165 story files (merged)
- Consistent APIs across all icons
- Single source of truth for each component

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "TypeScript error: Cannot find module"
→ Check barrel exports (atoms/index.ts, icons/index.ts)  
→ Verify you updated import paths in organisms

### "Storybook won't build"
→ Check story file imports  
→ Verify all component names match exports

### "Icon wrong size in organism"
→ Add explicit `size` prop (atoms defaults were smaller)  
→ GitHubIcon was size-4 (16px)  
→ DiscordIcon/XTwitterIcon were size-5 (20px)

### "Card missing features"
→ Ensure you kept atoms version (has CardAction)  
→ Don't use molecules version
