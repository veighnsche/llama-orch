# TEAM-006: ATOMS & MOLECULES

**Mission:** Create stories for atoms and molecules used in commercial site  
**Components:** 8 components (2 atoms, 6 molecules/misc)  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Priority:** P3 (Low Priority - Foundational)

---

## üéØ MISSION BRIEFING

You're documenting the **foundational components** - atoms and molecules that organisms are built from. These are smaller, reusable pieces.

### KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- **Atoms:** Single-purpose, minimal components (icons, buttons, badges)
- **Molecules:** Small compositions (brand logo, cards, simple layouts)
- **Usage:** Often INDIRECT (used by organisms, not imported directly by pages)

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ‚úÖ **Show ALL variants** - Atoms especially have many size/color/state variants
2. ‚úÖ **Document composition** - For molecules, show what atoms they're built from
3. ‚úÖ **NO viewport stories**
4. ‚úÖ **Keep it simple** - These are NOT complex organisms
5. ‚úÖ **Focus on props/API** - Document every prop clearly

## üéØ STORY REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

For EACH component, include:

### 1. Component Documentation
```markdown
## Overview
[What is this component? Single sentence.]

## Composition (for molecules)
This component is composed of:
- **[Atom/Component 1]**: [Purpose]
- **[Atom/Component 2]**: [Purpose]

## When to Use
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

## Variants
- **[Variant 1]**: [Description]
- **[Variant 2]**: [Description]

## Used In
- [Organism 1] (e.g., Navigation)
- [Organism 2] (e.g., Footer)
- [Page context] (e.g., Used in header across all pages)
```

### 2. Props Documentation (argTypes)
Every prop MUST be documented:
```typescript
argTypes: {
  propName: {
    control: 'text' | 'select' | 'boolean',
    description: 'Clear description of what this prop does',
    table: {
      type: { summary: 'string' },
      defaultValue: { summary: 'default' },
      category: 'Appearance' | 'Content' | 'Behavior',
    },
  },
}
```

### 3. Minimum Stories
- ‚úÖ `Default` - Standard configuration
- ‚úÖ `AllVariants` - Showcase all size/color/state variants (for atoms)
- ‚úÖ `UsageContext` - Show how it's used in actual organisms (for molecules)

**Atoms should have MORE variants than organisms!** Show every size, color, state.

---

## ‚úÖ QUALITY CHECKLIST

For EACH component:
- [ ] Story file exists (created or verified)
- [ ] Component overview documented
- [ ] Composition documented (for molecules)
- [ ] All props in argTypes with descriptions
- [ ] All variants shown (especially for atoms)
- [ ] Usage context documented
- [ ] Minimum 2-3 stories
- [ ] NO viewport stories
- [ ] Tested in Storybook
- [ ] Committed

**Total: 80 checklist items (10 per component √ó 8 components)**

---

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKER

### Atoms (2 components - REVIEW ONLY)
- [ ] GitHubIcon ‚úÖ Reviewed
- [ ] DiscordIcon ‚úÖ Reviewed

### Molecules (6 components - ENHANCE/CREATE)
- [ ] BrandLogo ‚úÖ Enhanced
- [ ] BrandMark ‚úÖ Reviewed
- [ ] Card ‚úÖ Enhanced
- [ ] TestimonialsSection ‚úÖ Created/Enhanced
- [ ] HomeSolutionSection ‚úÖ Investigated (may be organism)
- [ ] CodeExamplesSection ‚úÖ Investigated (may be handled by TEAM-003)

**Completion: 0/8 (0%)**

---

## üö® COORDINATION WITH OTHER TEAMS

**IMPORTANT:** Some components in your list might actually be organisms:
1. **HomeSolutionSection** - If it's complex, TEAM-002 handles it
2. **CodeExamplesSection** - If part of Developers page, TEAM-003 handles it
3. **TestimonialsSection** - Check if it's organism or molecule

**Before starting work on these:**
1. Check if another team is handling it
2. If unsure, create the story but coordinate
3. Don't duplicate work!

---

## üöÄ COMMIT MESSAGES

```bash

```

---

## üìû NOTES

**Atoms are SIMPLE:**
- Few props, many variants
- Show EVERY size, color, state
- Document thoroughly but keep it concise

**Molecules are SMALL COMPOSITIONS:**
- Document what atoms they're made of
- Show usage context (how organisms use them)
- More complex than atoms, simpler than organisms

**Don't overcomplicate:**
- These are NOT complex organisms
- Stories should be straightforward
- Focus on variants and usage

**If a component seems too complex:**
- It might be an organism, not a molecule
- Check with other teams
- Coordinate to avoid duplication
