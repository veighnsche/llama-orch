## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Philosophy
- **Transparent**: No hidden fees, no surprise charges
- **No Feature Gates**: Full orchestrator on every tier (not "lite" versions)
- **Start Free**: Open-source version is fully functional (not a trial)
- **Scale When Ready**: Pay only when you need enterprise features (SLAs, support, white-label)

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchor Pricing**
- **Reference Price**: Cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) at $0.03-$0.10 per 1K tokens
- **rbee Positioning**: Fixed infrastructure cost (predictable) vs. variable per-token cost (unpredictable)
- **Value Demonstration**: "Save 60-80% at scale vs. cloud APIs"

**Pricing Transparency**
- **No Hidden Fees**: All costs upfront (infrastructure, support, licenses)
- **No Surprise Charges**: Fixed monthly/annual pricing (not per-token)
- **No Feature Gates**: Full orchestrator on every tier (not "lite" versions)
- **Cancel Anytime**: No long-term contracts (except enterprise with SLAs)

**Objection Handling**
- **"Too expensive?"**: Show cost comparison vs. cloud APIs at scale
- **"Why not free forever?"**: Explain enterprise features (SLAs, support, white-label) require investment
- **"What if I outgrow free tier?"**: Emphasize smooth upgrade path, no migration needed

### Tier Structure

**Free/OSS (Home/Lab)**
- **Price**: $0 (open-source)
- **Target**: Solo developers, hobbyists, homelab enthusiasts
- **Features**: Full orchestrator, unlimited GPUs, OpenAI-compatible API, CLI access
- **Limitations**: No web UI, no team collaboration, community support only
- **Upgrade Trigger**: Need web UI, team collaboration, or priority support

**Pro (Team)**
- **Price**: TBD (monthly/annual)
- **Target**: Small teams (2-10 people)
- **Features**: Everything in Free + Web UI, team collaboration, priority email support
- **Limitations**: No SLA, no white-label, no professional services
- **Upgrade Trigger**: Need SLA, white-label, or professional services

**Enterprise**
- **Price**: Custom (contact sales)
- **Target**: Large enterprises (50-5000+ employees)
- **Features**: Everything in Pro + 99.9% uptime SLA, 24/7 support, dedicated account manager, white-label, professional services, multi-region support
- **Limitations**: None (all features included)
- **Upgrade Trigger**: N/A (top tier)

### Conversion Strategy
- **Primary CTA**: "View Plans" (self-serve, see pricing tiers)
- **Secondary CTA**: "Talk to Sales" (enterprise, custom pricing)
- **Lead qualification**: Capture use case, team size, infrastructure details
- **Proof points**: No feature gates, full orchestrator on every tier, OpenAI-compatible API, cancel anytime
