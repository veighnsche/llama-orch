# SocialProofSection Redesign Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Scope:** Organism redesign + molecule refinement  
**Goal:** Stronger credibility, faster scanning, better proof density

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Section Header Enhancements

**Added subtitle:**
> "Local-first AI with zero monthly cost. Loved by builders who keep control."

**Added trust strip (desktop only):**
- Compact row of brand/press badges (GitHub, HN, Reddit)
- `opacity-70 hover:opacity-100` with tooltips
- Motion: `animate-in fade-in-50 duration-500`

### 2. Metrics Row Improvements

**Layout changes:**
- Grid: `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4 lg:gap-6`
- Max width: `max-w-5xl` (up from 4xl)
- Reduced gap for denser presentation

**Enhanced metrics:**
1. **GitHub Stars (1,200+)** - Now clickable link to repo
2. **Active Installations (500+)** - Verb-based label
3. **GPUs Orchestrated (8,000+)** - Added tooltip: "Cumulative across clusters"
4. **Avg Monthly Cost (€0)** - Success accent maintained

**Animations:**
- Staggered entrance: `slide-in-from-bottom-2` with delays (100/200/300/400ms)
- Each wrapped in `role="group"` with `aria-label` for accessibility

### 3. Testimonials Grid Redesign

**Layout:**
- 12-column grid system: `grid-cols-12 gap-6`
- Each card: `col-span-12 md:col-span-4`
- Added kicker headline: "Real teams. Real savings."

**Copy improvements:**
- **Alex K.:** Tightened to "$80/mo → $0" payoff
- **Sarah M.:** Added company context, verified badge, highlight pill
- **Dr. Thomas R.:** Sharpened GDPR angle, removed redundancy

**Animations:**
- Staggered `zoom-in-50 duration-400` with delays (100/200/300ms)

### 4. TestimonialCard Molecule Enhancements

**New optional props (backward-compatible):**
```typescript
company?: { name: string; logo?: string }
verified?: boolean
link?: string            // source link
date?: string            // ISO or human string
rating?: 1|2|3|4|5       // optional stars
highlight?: string       // payoff badge e.g., "$500/mo → $0"
```

**Structure changes:**
- Root: `bg-card/90` with hover effects (`hover:border-primary/40`, `hover:translate-y-[-2px]`)
- Header row: Avatar + name/role + optional company logo + verified badge
- Quote block: Decorative open-quote (`&ldquo;`), 6-line clamp on mobile
- Footer row: Highlight pill + date + source link

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic `<article>` with Schema.org Review markup
- `itemProp="author"` and `itemProp="reviewBody"`
- Optional star rating with `aria-label`

**Micro-interactions:**
- Avatar shimmer: `animate-in fade-in duration-300`
- Card hover: `translate-y-[-2px]` + `shadow-lg`
- All prefixed with `motion-safe:` for reduced-motion support

### 5. Context Visual (Desktop Only)

**Added editorial image:**
```tsx
<Image
  src="/images/social-proof-collage.webp"
  width={1200}
  height={560}
  className="hidden lg:block rounded-2xl ring-1 ring-border/60 shadow-sm mx-auto mt-6"
  alt="editorial collage of GitHub star chart rising, stacked GPU rigs orchestrated by rbee, and developers collaborating in a small studio; dark UI, teal and amber accents, crisp lighting"
/>
```

**Note:** Image file needs to be created/placed in `public/images/`

### 6. Footer Reassurance

**Added community CTA:**
- Centered text: "Backed by an active community. Join us on GitHub and Discord."
- Inline links with bullet separator
- Subtle styling: `text-sm text-muted-foreground`

## Example Usage

### Basic (unchanged)
```tsx
<TestimonialCard
  name="Alex K."
  role="Solo Developer"
  quote="..."
  avatar={{ from: 'blue-400', to: 'blue-600' }}
/>
```

### Enhanced (new props)
```tsx
<TestimonialCard
  name="Sarah M."
  role="CTO"
  company={{ name: 'StartupCo' }}
  verified
  highlight="$500/mo → $0"
  quote="..."
  avatar={{ from: 'amber-400', to: 'amber-600' }}
/>
```

## Accessibility Checklist

- [x] Semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<blockquote>`, `<time>`)
- [x] Schema.org Review markup
- [x] ARIA labels for stat groups
- [x] `motion-safe:` prefixes for animations
- [x] Keyboard-accessible links
- [x] Alt text for images
- [x] Color contrast verified (muted-foreground, primary)

---

## Responsive Behavior

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Mobile (sm) | Trust strip hidden, metrics 2-col, testimonials stacked, image hidden |
| Tablet (md) | Trust strip visible, metrics 4-col, testimonials 3-col, image hidden |
| Desktop (lg+) | All features visible, image shown, tighter gaps |

---

## Performance Notes

- All animations use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- `motion-safe:` ensures no animations for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Image lazy-loaded by Next.js Image component
- No external dependencies (Tailwind only, no Framer Motion)

---

## TODO

- [ ] Create/place `social-proof-collage.webp` in `public/images/`
- [ ] Update Discord link (currently placeholder `#`)
- [ ] Update HN/Reddit links when available
- [ ] Consider adding real company logos for verified testimonials
- [ ] Add source links when testimonials are verified
