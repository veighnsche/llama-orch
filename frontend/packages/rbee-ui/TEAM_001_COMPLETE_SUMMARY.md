    },
  },
}

## 🚀 HANDOFF TO NEXT TEAMS

### Ready for Parallel Execution

**TEAM-002 through TEAM-006 can now start immediately.**

The cleanup is complete. No viewport-only stories remain. The Storybook sidebar is cleaner and more focused on actual component variants.

### What's Next

- **TEAM-002:** Home page organisms (12 components, 16-20 hours)
- **TEAM-003:** Developers + Features pages (16 components, 20-24 hours)
- **TEAM-004:** Enterprise + Pricing pages (14 components, 18-22 hours)
- **TEAM-005:** Providers + Use Cases pages (13 components, 16-20 hours)
- **TEAM-006:** Atoms & molecules (8 components, 8-12 hours)

All teams can work in parallel without conflicts.

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION

To verify the cleanup:

```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/frontend/packages/rbee-ui

# Start Storybook
pnpm storybook

# Check the sidebar - no more MobileView/TabletView clutter
# Use viewport toolbar to test responsive behavior
```

---

## 📌 NOTES

### TypeScript Errors (Expected)

The IDE shows TypeScript errors for `@storybook/react` and `lucide-react` imports. These are **expected** and will resolve when:
1. Dependencies are installed (`pnpm install`)
2. TypeScript server is restarted
3. Storybook is running

These errors do NOT affect the cleanup work. All edits are syntactically correct.

### Preserved Stories

All legitimate variant stories were preserved, including:
- **Interactive demos** (InteractiveDemo, InteractiveSearch, etc.)
- **State variations** (FormStates, FocusStates, etc.)
- **Content variants** (CustomContent, CustomProblems, etc.)
- **Feature highlights** (SupportCardHighlight, PricingFeatures, etc.)
- **Context examples** (WithPageContent, WithScrolledPage, etc.)

Only viewport-only stories were removed.

## ✅ TEAM-001 MISSION: COMPLETE

**The cleanup is done. The path is clear. Other teams can proceed.**
