# Build Fix Summary

**Date:** Oct 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL BUILDS PASSING

---

## Issue

After cleaning up legacy operations from `operations-contract`, the `rbee-keeper` package failed to compile with:

```
error[E0599]: no variant named `HiveRefreshCapabilities` found for enum `Operation`
  --> bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/hive.rs:126:40
```

---

## Root Cause

The `HiveRefreshCapabilities` operation was deleted from `operations-contract` as part of Rule Zero cleanup (removing legacy operations), but `rbee-keeper` was still trying to use it.

---

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed `RefreshCapabilities` from `HiveAction` enum

**File:** `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/hive.rs`

**Deleted:**
```rust
/// Refresh device capabilities for a hive
RefreshCapabilities {
    /// Host alias (default: localhost, or use SSH config entry)
    #[arg(short = 'a', long = "host", default_value = "localhost")]
    alias: String,
},
```

### 2. Removed handler for `RefreshCapabilities`

**Deleted:**
```rust
HiveAction::RefreshCapabilities { alias } => {
    let operation = Operation::HiveRefreshCapabilities { alias };
    submit_and_stream_job(queen_url, operation).await
}
```

### 3. Cleaned up unused imports

**Deleted:**
```rust
use operations_contract::Operation;
use crate::job_client::submit_and_stream_job;
```

These imports were only used by the deleted `RefreshCapabilities` handler.

---

## Verification

All three main packages now build successfully:

```bash
cargo build --package queen-rbee --package rbee-hive --package rbee-keeper
```

**Result:**
```
Compiling rbee-keeper v0.1.0
Compiling queen-rbee v0.1.0
Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 9.98s
```

✅ **queen-rbee** - Builds successfully  
✅ **rbee-hive** - Builds successfully  
✅ **rbee-keeper** - Builds successfully

## Related Changes

This fix completes the Rule Zero cleanup started earlier:

1. ✅ Removed legacy operations from `operations-contract`
2. ✅ Removed legacy operation handlers from `job_router.rs`
3. ✅ Removed legacy operation references from `rbee-keeper`

---

## Rule Zero Compliance

**"Breaking changes are temporary. Entropy is forever."**

By immediately deleting the deprecated `HiveRefreshCapabilities` operation and all its references, we:
- ✅ Eliminated technical debt
- ✅ Prevented confusion about which API to use
- ✅ Made the codebase easier to understand
- ✅ Let the compiler find all call sites (found in rbee-keeper)

The compiler error was a **feature, not a bug** - it helped us find and remove all references to the deleted operation.

---

## Summary

All compilation errors have been resolved. The codebase is now clean and Rule Zero compliant with no legacy operations remaining.
