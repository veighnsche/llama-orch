# TEAM-135: Placeholder feature for rbee-hive binary
# TODO: Replace with actual integration test features

Feature: rbee-hive binary integration
  As a developer
  I want integration tests for rbee-hive
  So that the binary behavior is verified

  Scenario: Binary placeholder test
    Given the rbee-hive binary is available
    When I run integration tests
    Then the test harness should be ready
