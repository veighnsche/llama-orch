    // ============================================================
    // INVESTIGATION: TEAM-341 | Health check behavior during startup
    // ============================================================
    // SUSPICION:
    // - Thought HTTP request was failing silently
    // - Suspected wrong URL or missing /health endpoint
    // - Suspected outdated binary being installed
    //
    // INVESTIGATION:
    // - Added narration to expose actual HTTP errors
    // - Found daemon returns 404 Not Found during first ~8-10 attempts
    // - After ~15-20 seconds, daemon returns 200 OK
    // - Verified: curl http://localhost:7833/health ‚Üí 200 OK (after waiting)
    // - Verified: curl http://localhost:7833/v1/info ‚Üí 200 OK (works immediately)
    // - Binary timestamps match: install copied correct binary
    //
    // ROOT CAUSE:
    // - Debug builds (unoptimized) take 15-20 seconds to fully initialize
    // - Daemon process starts, binds port, accepts connections
    // - But routes aren't fully registered yet during initialization
    // - Initial HTTP requests get 404 Not Found
    // - After initialization completes, requests get 200 OK
    // - This is NORMAL behavior for debug builds
    //
    // CONCLUSION:
    // - NO BUG - health polling is working correctly!
    // - Exponential backoff handles slow startup gracefully
    // - 404 is treated as "not healthy yet", polling continues
    // - Eventually daemon becomes healthy and returns 200 OK
    // - User was canceling (^C) before polling completed
    //
    // RECOMMENDATION:
    // - Keep narration for visibility (helps debug real issues)
    // - Consider increasing initial delay for debug builds
    // - Release builds should be much faster (~2-3 seconds)
