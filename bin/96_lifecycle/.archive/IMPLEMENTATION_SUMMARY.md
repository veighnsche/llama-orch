# Binary Metadata Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Status:** ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented stateless binary mode detection using `shadow-rs` and smart binary selection logic.

**Goal:** Enable lifecycle-local to correctly identify and launch either development or production builds without state files.

---

## What Was Actually Implemented

### **Phase 1: Build Metadata (shadow-rs)**

Added `shadow-rs` crate to embed build mode into all 3 daemon binaries.

**Binaries Updated:**
- `queen-rbee` ✅
- `rbee-hive` ✅
- `llm-worker-rbee` ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created/updated `build.rs` files with `shadow_rs::new()`
- Added `shadow!(build)` macro to all `main.rs` files
- Added `--build-info` flag that outputs "debug" or "release"

**LOC:** ~59 lines added

---

### **Phase 2: Mode Detection Functions**

Implemented functions to read build mode from binaries.

**Functions Added:**
- `get_binary_mode(path) -> Result<String>` - Execute binary with `--build-info`
- `is_release_binary(path) -> Result<bool>` - Helper for release detection

**Tests:** 8 comprehensive tests (all passing)

**LOC:** +178 lines (including tests)

---

### **Phase 3: Smart Binary Selection**

Made `check_binary_exists()` smart by adding `CheckMode` parameter.

**RULE ZERO Compliant:**
- ✅ Updated existing function (not created new one)
- ✅ Deleted `check_binary_actually_installed()`
- ✅ One way to do things

**CheckMode Enum:**
- `Any` - Check all locations, prefer production if installed
- `InstalledOnly` - Check only ~/.local/bin/

**Smart Selection Logic:**
1. Check ~/.local/bin/ first
2. If exists AND release mode → USE IT
3. Otherwise fall back to target/debug/
4. Otherwise fall back to target/release/

**LOC:** +44 lines

---

### **Phase 4: Update Install**

Updated `install_daemon()` to use new `CheckMode::InstalledOnly`.

**Change:** Minimal surgical update to use new API.

**LOC:** +2 lines

---

## Total Impact

**Lines Added:** ~283 LOC  
**Lines Deleted:** ~35 LOC (old function)  
**Net:** ~248 LOC

**Files Modified:**
- 3 binaries (queen, hive, worker)
- lifecycle-local/src/utils/binary.rs
- lifecycle-local/src/install.rs
- lifecycle-local/src/start.rs
- lifecycle-local/src/status.rs

---

## Testing Results

### **Manual Testing:**
```bash
./target/debug/queen-rbee --build-info        # → debug ✅
./target/release/queen-rbee --build-info       # → release ✅
./target/debug/rbee-hive --build-info          # → debug ✅
./target/debug/llm-worker-rbee --build-info    # → debug ✅
```

### **Unit Tests:**
```
running 8 tests
test test_detect_debug_binary ... ok
test test_detect_release_binary ... ok
test test_llm_worker_debug ... ok
test test_llm_worker_release ... ok
test test_rbee_hive_debug ... ok
test test_rbee_hive_release ... ok
test test_missing_binary ... ok
test test_binary_without_build_info ... ok

test result: ok. 8 passed; 0 failed
```

### **Compilation:**
```bash
cargo check -p lifecycle-local  # ✅ PASS
cargo check -p queen-rbee       # ✅ PASS
cargo check -p rbee-hive        # ✅ PASS
cargo check -p llm-worker-rbee  # ✅ PASS
```

---

## RULE ZERO Compliance

✅ **Phase 1:** Added shadow-rs (new dependency, not code duplication)  
✅ **Phase 2:** New functions (no existing equivalent)  
✅ **Phase 3:** Updated existing `check_binary_exists()` instead of creating new  
✅ **Phase 4:** Used updated function instead of creating wrapper  

**Violations:** ZERO  
**Deleted Functions:** 1 (`check_binary_actually_installed`)  
**New Functions:** 2 (both necessary, no existing equivalent)

---

## Architecture Correctness

### **Install Flow:**
```
install_daemon():
  1. Build binary (debug or release based on parent)
  2. ALWAYS copy to ~/.local/bin/
  3. Binary has metadata (--build-info)
```

### **Start Flow:**
```
start_daemon():
  1. check_binary_exists(daemon, CheckMode::Any)
     - Check ~/.local/bin/ first
     - If exists AND release mode → USE IT
     - If exists AND debug mode → SKIP IT, use target/debug/
     - Fall back to target/release/
  2. Start the selected binary
```

### **Why This Works:**
- **Install** creates metadata in ~/.local/bin/
- **Start** reads metadata and makes smart choice
- **No state needed** - metadata IS the state
- **Works for both modes** - debug and release

---

## Lessons Learned

### **What Worked:**
- Using established crate (shadow-rs) instead of custom solution
- Minimal, surgical changes following RULE ZERO
- Comprehensive testing before moving to next phase

### **What Was Corrected:**
- Initial plan proposed creating new functions (RULE ZERO violation)
- User caught the mistake and implementation was corrected
- Final implementation is RULE ZERO compliant

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 5:** Comprehensive end-to-end testing (if needed)

**Current Status:** All core functionality implemented and tested. System is ready for use.
