## Quick Revert

```bash
# From repo root
git checkout bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs
git checkout bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/job_client.rs
git checkout bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/builder.rs
git checkout bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/lib.rs
git checkout bin/99_shared_crates/job-registry/src/lib.rs

# Remove new files
rm -f bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/context.rs

## What Changed

### Modified Files
1. `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs` - Added correlation_id generation, tried task-local context
2. `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/job_client.rs` - Added correlation_id generation (then removed)
3. `bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/builder.rs` - Added with_job_id(), short_job_id(), auto-inject logic
4. `bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/lib.rs` - Added context module exports
5. `bin/99_shared_crates/job-registry/src/lib.rs` - Tried task-local context

### New Files Created
1. `bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/context.rs` - Task-local context (FAILED)
2. `bin/NARRATION_AND_JOB_ID_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation
3. `bin/TASK_LOCAL_CONTEXT_DOESNT_WORK.md` - Why task-local failed
4. `bin/FINAL_ANSWER_JOB_ID_REPETITION.md` - Why repetition is necessary
5. `bin/METAPROGRAMMING_SOLUTIONS_FOR_NARRATION.md` - Explored solutions
6. `bin/REVERT_NARRATION_CHANGES.diff` - Full diff of changes
7. `bin/REVERT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This file

## What to Keep

**Keep these docs** (useful reference):
- `bin/NARRATION_AND_JOB_ID_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `bin/FINAL_ANSWER_JOB_ID_REPETITION.md`
- `bin/METAPROGRAMMING_SOLUTIONS_FOR_NARRATION.md`

**Delete these** (failed experiments):
- `bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/context.rs`
- `bin/TASK_LOCAL_CONTEXT_DOESNT_WORK.md`

## Original Working State

The original state had:
- `.job_id(&job_id)` on all narration calls (REQUIRED for SSE routing)
- No correlation_id (can be added later if needed)
- No task-local context (doesn't work)
- Simple, explicit narration calls

## Why Revert?

1. Task-local context approach **FAILED** (events still dropped)
2. Added complexity without benefit
3. Original approach is correct and working
4. Repetition is necessary for the architecture

## Summary

**The fix that actually worked:** Adding `.job_id(&job_id)` to all narration calls.

**What didn't work:** Trying to eliminate the repetition with task-local context.

**Lesson:** Sometimes repetition is the answer. Accept it and move on.
