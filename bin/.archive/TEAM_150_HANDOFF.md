# TEAM-150 Handoff

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Mission:** Fix streaming hang bug from TEAM-149  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Tokens now stream in real-time

---

## What We Fixed

### Root Cause: Blocking narration_stream

TEAM-149's implementation had a **stream composition bug**:

```rust
// BROKEN: narration_stream blocks forever
let stream_with_done = narration_stream      // ← BLOCKS HERE
    .chain(started_stream)
    .chain(token_events)                     // ← Never reached!
    .chain(done_marker);
```

**Why it blocked:**
1. `create_channel()` stores sender in thread-local storage
2. Sender **never dropped** (still alive in TLS)
3. `UnboundedReceiverStream` waits for messages that never come
4. Generation engine runs in `spawn_blocking` (different thread, can't access TLS)
5. Stream chain never reaches `token_events`!

### The Fix

**Removed narration_stream entirely:**

```rust
// WORKING: Direct chain to token_events
let stream_with_done = started_stream
    .chain(token_events)                     // ← Now reached immediately!
    .chain(done_marker);
```

Tokens now stream in real-time! 🎉

## Files Modified

### `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/src/http/execute.rs` (TEAM-150)
- **Removed:** `narration_channel::create_channel()` call
- **Removed:** `narration_stream` from SSE chain
- **Removed:** Unused imports (`narration_channel`, `UnboundedReceiverStream`)
- **Result:** Stream flows directly: `started_event → token_events → [DONE]`

### `xtask/src/tasks/worker.rs` (TEAM-150)
- **Added:** 30-second timeout for SSE stream reading
- **Added:** Timeout check on every line read
- **Result:** Test kills itself after 30s instead of hanging for 3+ minutes

---

## Verification

### Compilation
```bash
cargo check --bin llm-worker-rbee  # ✅ PASSES
```

### Runtime Testing
```bash
cargo xtask worker:test  # ✅ PASSES

📡 Streaming tokens (30s timeout):
▁a ▁cities ▁of ▁fran ce . K ing dom ▁of ▁fran ce ▁is ▁known...
✅ Received [DONE] signal

📊 Inference Test Results
Tokens received: 45
[DONE] signal: ✅
✅ INFERENCE TEST PASSED!
```

**Confirmed:** Tokens stream in real-time, no more 3+ minute hangs!

## Technical Details

### Stream Composition Bug Pattern

**Lazy streams + blocking receiver = hang:**

```rust
// BAD: Receiver waits forever if sender never dropped
let blocking = UnboundedReceiverStream::new(rx);  // Sender in TLS
let real_data = async_stream::stream! { ... };

blocking.chain(real_data)  // real_data NEVER polled!
```

**Fix: Only chain streams that will complete:**

```rust
// GOOD: No blocking streams
let real_data = async_stream::stream! { ... };
let done = stream::once(future::ready(value));

real_data.chain(done)  // Works immediately
```

### Thread-Local Storage + spawn_blocking Incompatibility

- TLS is **per-thread**
- `spawn_blocking` runs on **blocking thread pool**
- Generation engine **can't access HTTP handler's TLS**
- Narration sender unreachable from generation code

## Code Signatures

TEAM-150 signatures added to:
- `src/http/execute.rs` (removed blocking stream)
