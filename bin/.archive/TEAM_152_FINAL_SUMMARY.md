## 🎭 Narration Examples

### Scenario 1: Queen Not Running

```
⚠️  queen is asleep, waking queen.
```

**Narration Events Emitted:**
```json
{
  "actor": "rbee-keeper",
  "action": "queen_start",
  "target": "queen-rbee",
  "human": "Queen is asleep, waking queen"
}
{
  "actor": "rbee-keeper",
  "action": "queen_start",
  "target": "target/debug/queen-rbee",
  "human": "Found queen-rbee binary at target/debug/queen-rbee"
}
{
  "actor": "rbee-keeper",
  "action": "queen_start",
  "target": "12345",
  "human": "Queen-rbee process spawned, waiting for health check"
}
{
  "actor": "rbee-keeper",
  "action": "queen_poll",
  "target": "health",
  "human": "Polling queen health (attempt 1, delay 100ms)"
}
{
  "actor": "rbee-keeper",
  "action": "queen_ready",
  "target": "queen-rbee",
  "human": "Queen is awake and healthy",
  "duration_ms": 1234
}
```

```
✅ queen is awake and healthy.
```

### Scenario 2: Queen Already Running

**Narration Event:**
```json
{
  "actor": "rbee-keeper",
  "action": "queen_check",
  "target": "http://localhost:8500",
  "human": "Queen is already running and healthy"
}
```

No console output (returns immediately).

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Build Status
```bash
cargo build --bin rbee-keeper --bin queen-rbee
# ✅ Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.44s
```

### End-to-End Test 1: Auto-Start
```bash
pkill -f queen-rbee  # Ensure queen is not running
./target/debug/rbee-keeper infer "hello" --model HF:author/minillama

# Output:
# ⚠️  queen is asleep, waking queen.
# ✅ queen is awake and healthy.
# TODO: Implement infer command (submit job to queen)
```

### End-to-End Test 2: Already Running
```bash
./target/debug/rbee-keeper infer "world" --model HF:author/minillama

# Output:
# TODO: Implement infer command (submit job to queen)
# (No "waking queen" message - returns immediately)
```

### Narration Verification
```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/rbee-keeper infer "test" --model HF:author/minillama

# Narration events emitted to structured logs
# Human-readable messages printed to stdout
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Observability
- **Narration-core integration** - All lifecycle events narrated
- **Actor/Action/Target taxonomy** - Consistent event structure
- **Human-readable descriptions** - Clear messages for operators
- **Duration tracking** - Performance metrics included

### ✅ Shared Crate Pattern
- daemon-lifecycle in `99_shared_crates/`
- Will be reused by queen→hive and hive→worker

### ✅ Minimal Binary Pattern
- Business logic in crates
- Binaries only for CLI/HTTP

### ✅ Narration Module Pattern
- All narration in dedicated `narration.rs` file
- Constants for actors and actions
- Reusable narration functions

---

## 📝 Narration Design Decisions

### Why Separate Narration Module?

Per narration-core README recommendation:
> "Prefer to make a narration file where all the narration is defined then imported"

**Benefits:**
1. **Centralized** - All narration in one place
2. **Reusable** - Functions can be called from anywhere
3. **Consistent** - Same actor/action constants throughout
4. **Testable** - Easy to verify narration events in tests
5. **Maintainable** - Easy to update messages

### Actor & Action Constants

```rust
pub const ACTOR_RBEE_KEEPER: &str = "rbee-keeper";
pub const ACTION_QUEEN_CHECK: &str = "queen_check";
pub const ACTION_QUEEN_START: &str = "queen_start";
pub const ACTION_QUEEN_POLL: &str = "queen_poll";
pub const ACTION_QUEEN_READY: &str = "queen_ready";
```

**Why constants?**
- Type safety
- Autocomplete in IDE
- Easy to grep
- Consistent naming

## 🤝 Handoff to TEAM-153

### What's Ready
- ✅ Queen auto-starts with narration
- ✅ Health polling with observability
- ✅ All lifecycle events tracked
- ✅ Clean error handling
- ✅ BDD tests
- ✅ Documentation

### What's Next
TEAM-153 will implement:
- Job submission (POST /jobs)
- SSE connection
- Token streaming
- **Add narration for job submission events**

### Narration Pattern for TEAM-153

```rust
// In job submission code
use narration::*;

narrate_job_submitted(&job_id, &model);
narrate_sse_connecting(&sse_url);
narrate_token_received(&token);
narrate_job_complete(&job_id, duration_ms);
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Went Well
1. **Narration-core integration** - Clean API, easy to use
2. **Separate narration module** - Excellent organization
3. **Builder pattern** - Ergonomic narration API
4. **Incremental testing** - Verified each step

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Cute mode** - Requires feature flag, removed for simplicity
2. **Narration module structure** - Found best practice pattern
3. **Event timing** - Tracked duration for performance metrics

### Best Practices Established
1. **One narration.rs per crate** - Centralized definitions
2. **Constants for actors/actions** - Type-safe, consistent
3. **Narration at key lifecycle points** - Not too verbose
4. **Duration tracking** - Performance observability
