# TEAM-341: Queen UI 404 Bug - Root Cause & Fix

**Date:** Oct 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

`http://localhost:7833/` returns **404 Not Found** when queen is started from rbee-keeper GUI.

`http://localhost:7833/ui` returns empty response (not 404, just blank).

---

## Investigation

### Symptoms

```bash
# API works fine
curl http://localhost:7833/health
# → 200 OK

# UI returns 404
curl http://localhost:7833/
# → 404 Not Found (content-length: 0)

# /ui path returns blank
curl http://localhost:7833/ui
# → 200 OK (but empty body)
```

### Binary Analysis

```bash
# Check which binary is running
ps aux | grep queen-rbee
# → /home/vince/.local/bin/queen-rbee --port 7833

# Check binary timestamps
stat -c "%y %n" ~/.local/bin/queen-rbee target/debug/queen-rbee
# → 2025-10-29 16:38:58 ~/.local/bin/queen-rbee
# → 2025-10-29 16:51:31 target/debug/queen-rbee

# UI dist was built AFTER the binary was compiled!
ls -l bin/10_queen_rbee/ui/app/dist/
# → 2025-10-29 17:00 (13 minutes AFTER ~/.local/bin binary was built!)
```

### Root Cause

1. **Old binary in ~/.local/bin**: Built at 16:38 (before UI was ready)
2. **Fresh binary in target/debug**: Built at 16:51 (with current UI)
3. **daemon-lifecycle priority**: Checks `which queen-rbee` FIRST, finds old binary

**Binary search order (WRONG):**
```bash
which queen-rbee                # ← Finds ~/.local/bin/queen-rbee (OLD!) 
~/.local/bin/queen-rbee         # Skipped (found via which)
target/release/queen-rbee       # Never reached
target/debug/queen-rbee         # Never reached
```

---

## The Bug

**File:** `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/start.rs` (line 226-231)

**Problem:** Binary search prioritizes PATH over build directory.

```rust
// OLD CODE (BUGGY)
let find_cmd = format!(
    "which {} 2>/dev/null || \              // ← WRONG! Finds old binary first
     (test -x ~/.local/bin/{} && ...) || \
     (test -x target/release/{} && ...) || \
     (test -x target/debug/{} && ...) || \
     echo 'NOT_FOUND'",
    daemon_name, ...
);
```

**Why this is wrong:**
- Development: User runs `cargo build` → new binary in `target/debug/`
- User clicks "Start Queen" in GUI → daemon-lifecycle uses OLD binary from `~/.local/bin/`
- Old binary has outdated embedded UI or missing static files
- Result: 404 on root path

---

## The Fix

**Priority order (CORRECT):**
```bash
target/debug/queen-rbee         # ← Check build directory FIRST (dev)
target/release/queen-rbee       # Then check release
~/.local/bin/queen-rbee         # Then check installed location
which queen-rbee                # Finally check PATH
```

**Fixed code:**
```rust
// TEAM-341: CRITICAL FIX - Prioritize target/ over ~/.local/bin for development
let find_cmd = format!(
    "(test -x target/debug/{} && echo target/debug/{}) || \      // ← Dev first!
     (test -x target/release/{} && echo target/release/{}) || \  // Then production
     (test -x ~/.local/bin/{} && echo ~/.local/bin/{}) || \      // Then installed
     which {} 2>/dev/null || \                                    // Finally PATH
     echo 'NOT_FOUND'",
    daemon_name, daemon_name, daemon_name, daemon_name, daemon_name, daemon_name, daemon_name
);
```

## Why This Pattern is Correct

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Developer builds UI
cd bin/10_queen_rbee/ui/app && pnpm build

# 2. Developer builds queen binary (embeds UI via build.rs)
cd ../.. && cargo build

# 3. Developer starts queen via GUI
# → daemon-lifecycle finds target/debug/queen-rbee (FRESH!)
# → UI works correctly
```

### Production Workflow
```bash
# 1. Install queen binary
rbee queen install

# 2. Start queen via GUI
# → No target/ directory present
# → daemon-lifecycle finds ~/.local/bin/queen-rbee
# → Production binary works correctly
```

### Key Insight

**Development builds should ALWAYS use binaries from `target/`**, not from `~/.local/bin/`.

The `~/.local/bin/` location is for **installed** binaries (production), not development.

---

## Verification

### Before Fix
```bash
# Start queen
rbee-keeper GUI → Start Queen

# Check which binary is running
ps aux | grep queen-rbee
# → /home/vince/.local/bin/queen-rbee (OLD!)

# Test UI
curl http://localhost:7833/
# → 404 Not Found ❌
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Kill old queen
kill $(pgrep queen-rbee)

# Start queen again
rbee-keeper GUI → Start Queen

# Check which binary is running
ps aux | grep queen-rbee
# → target/debug/queen-rbee (FRESH!) ✅

# Test UI
curl http://localhost:7833/
# → 200 OK (HTML content from Vite proxy) ✅
```

## Impact

**Affected operations:**
- `start_daemon()` - Fixed ✅
- `install_daemon()` - Also needs fix (uses `build_daemon()`)
- `rebuild_daemon()` - Also needs fix

**Affected services:**
- queen-rbee ✅
- rbee-hive (same issue)
- llm-worker (same issue)

## Related Issues

### Why `/ui` Path Returns Empty

The binary is in **debug mode** (`cfg(debug_assertions)`), which means:
1. It tries to proxy to Vite dev server (correct)
2. But the fallback router isn't being triggered (router merge issue)

**This is a SEPARATE bug** (router priority), not the 404 issue.

The 404 bug is because the binary search finds the OLD binary with outdated embedded files.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **PATH is not for development binaries** - Use `target/` for dev, `~/.local/bin/` for production
2. **Binary timestamps matter** - Old binaries = old embedded files
3. **Build order matters** - UI must be built BEFORE Rust compilation (build.rs handles this)
4. **Test binary location** - Always check WHICH binary is actually running

## Files Changed

- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/start.rs` - Binary search priority fixed

**Commit message:**
```
fix(daemon-lifecycle): prioritize target/ over ~/.local/bin for dev builds

CRITICAL FIX: When starting daemons in development, always use fresh
binaries from target/ instead of old installed binaries from ~/.local/bin/.

This ensures the UI and all embedded assets are up-to-date.

Root cause: daemon-lifecycle was checking `which` first, which found
old binaries in PATH (~/.local/bin/) before checking target/.

Impact: All daemons (queen, hive, workers) now use fresh builds in dev.

Fixes: TEAM-341 (queen UI 404 bug)
