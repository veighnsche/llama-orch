# TEAM-155: Narration System Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Issue:** Narration system had critical design flaw with provenance tracking

---

## The Problem

**TEAM-152's original design:**
```
(observability-narration-core@0.0.0) Message
```

This was wrong because:
1. Used `env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME")` which expands in narration-core, not the caller
2. Required convoluted `narrate!()` macro wrapper to capture caller's crate name
3. Added unnecessary version tracking that nobody asked for
4. Over-complicated a simple logging system

---

## The Solution

**Use the actor name as provenance!**

The actor name was already being passed to `Narration::new()` as the first parameter. We just needed to use it!

**New output format:**
```
[actor] message
```

**Changes made:**

1. **Modified `narration-core/src/lib.rs`:**
   - Changed output from `(crate@version)` to `[actor]`
   - Removed dependency on `emitted_by` field
   - Simplified to: `eprintln!("[{}] {}", fields.actor, human);`

2. **Added emoji prefixes for visual identification:**
   - 🧑‍🌾 = Bee keeper (rbee-keeper)
   - 👑 = Queen bee (queen-rbee)
   - 🍯 = Bee hive (rbee-hive) - *to be added*
   - 🐝 = Worker bee (llm-worker-rbee)
   - ⚙️ = Shared crates (daemon-lifecycle, etc.)

---

## Example Output

**Before (broken):**
```
(observability-narration-core@0.0.0) Queen is asleep, waking queen
(observability-narration-core@0.0.0) Found binary at: target/debug/queen-rbee
(observability-narration-core@0.0.0) Queen-rbee starting on port 8500
```

**After (fixed):**
```
[🧑‍🌾 rbee-keeper] ⚠️  Queen is asleep, waking queen
[⚙️ daemon-lifecycle] Found binary at: target/debug/queen-rbee
[🧑‍🌾 rbee-keeper] Found queen-rbee binary at target/debug/queen-rbee
[⚙️ daemon-lifecycle] Spawning daemon with PID 377042
[👑 queen-rbee] Queen-rbee starting on port 8500
[👑 queen-rbee] Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8500
[👑 queen-rbee] Ready to accept connections
[🧑‍🌾 rbee-keeper] ✅ Queen is awake and healthy
```

## Files Modified

**Core fix:**
- `bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/lib.rs` - Changed output format

**Emoji prefixes added:**
- `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/queen-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` - 🧑‍🌾 rbee-keeper
- `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/main.rs` - 👑 queen-rbee
- `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/jobs.rs` - 👑 queen-http
- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` - ⚙️ daemon-lifecycle
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/src/narration.rs` - 🐝 worker actors

---

## What We Learned

1. **Don't over-engineer** - Version tracking was never requested
2. **Use what you have** - Actor name was already there!
3. **Macros are code smell** - If you need a macro to work around a design flaw, fix the design
4. **Keep it simple** - `[actor] message` is all we need

---

## Remaining Work

**For next team:**
- Add 🍯 emoji to rbee-hive actors (when implemented)
- Remove the `narrate!()` macro entirely from narration-core (it's now unused)
- Remove `emitted_by` field from `NarrationFields` (no longer needed)
- Clean up auto-injection code that's now obsolete

---

## Benefits

✅ **Simple** - No macros, no magic, just `[actor] message`  
✅ **Visual** - Emojis make it easy to scan logs  
✅ **Correct** - Actor name is always accurate  
✅ **Clean** - No version numbers cluttering output
