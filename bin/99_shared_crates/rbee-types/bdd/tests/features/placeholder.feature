# TEAM-135: Placeholder feature for rbee-types
# TODO: Replace with actual feature files

Feature: rbee-types placeholder
  As a developer
  I want placeholder tests
  So that the BDD structure is ready

  Scenario: Placeholder test
    Given the BDD harness is set up
    When I run the tests
    Then the structure should be ready
