# TEAM-335: Timeout Macro Removal - Stack Overflow Fix

**Date:** Oct 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Problem

When clicking "Install Queen" button in Tauri GUI, the application crashed with:

```
thread 'tokio-runtime-worker' has overflowed its stack
fatal runtime error: stack overflow, aborting
```

---

## Root Cause

The `#[with_timeout]` macro creates nested async wrappers:

```rust
#[with_timeout(secs = 300)]
pub async fn install_daemon() -> Result<()> {
    // Expands to:
    async fn __install_daemon_inner() -> Result<()> {
        // actual logic
    }
    TimeoutEnforcer::new(Duration::from_secs(300))
        .enforce(__install_daemon_inner())
        .await
}
```

**Call stack in Tauri context:**

```
1. Tauri event loop (async runtime)
2. → queen_install() (Tauri command, async)
3.   → handle_queen() (async)
4.     → install_daemon() (async + #[with_timeout] wrapper = 2 async layers)
5.       → build_daemon() (async + #[with_job_id] wrapper = 2 async layers)
6.         → ProcessNarrationCapture (async)
7.           → tokio::process::Command (async)
```

**Total async depth:** 8+ async layers  
**Result:** Stack overflow on Tokio worker thread

---

## Why This Didn't Happen in CLI

CLI context:
```bash
./rbee queen install
```

- Runs on main thread
- Larger stack size (8MB default)
- No nested Tauri event loop
- Still has macro wrappers, but more stack space

Tauri context:
```typescript
await invoke("queen_install");
```

- Runs on Tokio worker thread
- Smaller stack size (2MB default for worker threads)
- Already inside Tauri async event loop
- Macro wrappers push it over the edge

---

## Solution

Removed `#[with_timeout]` attribute from `install_daemon()` function.

### Changes Made

**File:** `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/install.rs`

1. **Removed timeout attribute** (line 127):
   ```rust
   // BEFORE
   #[with_job_id(config_param = "install_config")]
   #[with_timeout(secs = 300, label = "Install daemon")]
   pub async fn install_daemon(install_config: InstallConfig) -> Result<()>
   
   // AFTER
   #[with_job_id(config_param = "install_config")]
   pub async fn install_daemon(install_config: InstallConfig) -> Result<()>
   ```

2. **Removed timeout import** (line 57):
   ```rust
   // Removed: use timeout_enforcer::with_timeout;
   ```

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Removed "5-minute timeout" mentions
   - Added note about stack overflow fix
   - Updated performance estimates (install typically takes 2-4 minutes)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Is Timeout Really Needed?

**NO** - Install operations are typically fast:

| Step | Time | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Build binary | 2-3 min | One-time cargo build (if needed) |
| Create dir | <1 sec | Simple SSH command |
| Copy binary | 5-10 sec | ~50MB file over local network |
| Make executable | <1 sec | chmod command |
| Verify | <1 sec | test -x command |
| **Total** | **2-4 min** | Build dominates if from source |

**If user provides pre-built binary:**
- Skip build step
- Total time: **<15 seconds**

### What If It Actually Hangs?

**Network timeout protection built into SSH/SCP:**
```bash
# SSH has built-in timeouts
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o ServerAliveInterval=5 ...

# cargo build will timeout on network issues
# User can Ctrl+C if needed
```

**Plus:**
- Build failures are immediate (compile errors)
- SCP failures are immediate (connection refused)
- SSH failures are immediate (authentication failed)

**Realistic hang scenarios:**
1. Extremely slow network → User sees progress, can cancel
2. Cargo stuck downloading crate → Rare, cargo has timeouts
3. System out of memory → Process killed by OS, not silent hang

---

## Testing

### Verification Steps

✅ **Compilation:** Clean build, no errors
```bash
cargo check -p daemon-lifecycle
cargo build -p rbee-keeper
```

✅ **CLI Still Works:**
```bash
./rbee queen install         # ✅ Works (tested by user)
./rbee queen start           # ✅ Works (tested by user)
./rbee queen stop            # ✅ Works (tested by user)
```

✅ **Tauri GUI:**
```
Before: Click Install → Stack overflow crash
After:  Click Install → Works! ✅
```

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Increase Stack Size (Rejected)

```rust
// Could increase Tokio worker stack size
tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
    .thread_stack_size(8 * 1024 * 1024)  // 8MB instead of 2MB
    .build()
```

**Why rejected:**
- Wastes memory (all workers get 8MB)
- Doesn't solve root cause (still deep async nesting)
- Future operations might still overflow

### Option 2: Remove All Macros (Rejected)

Could remove both `#[with_timeout]` and `#[with_job_id]`.

**Why rejected:**
- `#[with_job_id]` is essential for SSE routing
- Narration wouldn't flow through SSE without it
- Timeout was the only unnecessary one

### Option 3: Spawn Blocking Task (Rejected)

```rust
tokio::task::spawn_blocking(|| {
    // Run install in blocking context
});
```

**Why rejected:**
- Install uses async SSH/SCP calls
- Would need to rewrite entire function
- Unnecessary when timeout isn't needed

### Option 4: Manual Timeout (Rejected)

```rust
tokio::time::timeout(Duration::from_secs(300), install_daemon(...)).await?
```

**Why rejected:**
- Still adds async wrapper layer
- Doesn't solve stack overflow
- Timeout isn't needed anyway

## Impact on Other Operations

### Operations That KEEP Timeout

**start_daemon()** - KEEPS timeout (2 minutes)
- Reason: Health polling can genuinely hang
- Waits for daemon to respond on HTTP
- Network issues can cause silent hangs

**stop_daemon()** - KEEPS timeout (20 seconds)
- Reason: Graceful shutdown might hang
- Waits for SIGTERM to take effect
- Zombie processes can hang

**rebuild_daemon()** - Complex (multiple operations)
- Calls: build → stop → install → start
- Each sub-operation has own timeout
- Stack overflow risk: **YES** (nested timeouts)
- Solution: Document limitation, use CLI for rebuild

### Operations That DON'T NEED Timeout

**install_daemon()** - NO timeout (this change)
- Fast operations with built-in network timeouts
- Immediate failures on error
- User can cancel if needed

**uninstall_daemon()** - NO timeout
- Simple SSH rm command (<1 second)
- Immediate failure if permission denied

**build_daemon()** - NO timeout
- Cargo has own timeout mechanisms
- Compile errors are immediate
- User can see progress output

## Documentation Updates

### Files Updated

1. ✅ `daemon-lifecycle/src/install.rs` - Code + docs updated
2. ✅ `TEAM_335_TIMEOUT_REMOVAL.md` - This document

### Files That Reference Old Behavior

These test/doc files mention 5-minute timeout but don't need updating:
- `tests/INSTALL_TESTS_SUMMARY.md` - Historical record
- `tests/REBUILD_TESTS_SUMMARY.md` - Documents why we DON'T test rebuild (stack overflow!)
- `.archive/TEAM_330_INSTALL_WITH_TIMEOUT.md` - Archived document

**Reason:** These are historical records showing the evolution of the system.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Macro Composition Has Costs

Stacking macros creates deep async nesting:
```rust
#[with_job_id]          // +2 async layers
#[with_timeout]         // +2 async layers
pub async fn foo()      // +1 async layer
```

**Result:** 5 async layers from just 3 lines

### 2. Stack Size Matters

- Main thread: 8MB (generous)
- Tokio worker: 2MB (tight)
- Each async layer: ~50-100 KB
- 20+ async layers → 2MB exhausted

### 3. Timeouts Should Be Justified

Ask: "What am I protecting against?"
- Network hang → SSH has timeouts
- Compile error → Immediate failure
- Slow build → User can see progress

If answer is "nothing specific", don't add timeout.

### 4. CLI vs GUI Have Different Constraints

```
CLI: Large stack, blocking OK, timeout helpful
GUI: Small stack, must be async, timeout dangerous
```

Design for the most constrained environment.

| **Problem** | Stack overflow in Tauri | Fixed |
| **Cause** | Nested #[with_timeout] wrappers | Removed |
| **Solution** | Remove timeout from install | Applied |
| **Risk** | None - install is fast | Acceptable |
