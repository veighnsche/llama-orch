//! Build operation configuration types
//!
//! TEAM-329: Created for PARITY (each operation gets its own types file)
//!
//! build.rs has no configuration types - it's a simple operation that just
//! runs `cargo build`. This file exists for structural parity only.

// No types needed for build operation
