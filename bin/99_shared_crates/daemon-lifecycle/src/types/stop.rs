//! Stop operation configuration types
//!
//! TEAM-329: Created for PARITY (each operation gets its own types file)
//!
//! stop.rs uses HttpDaemonConfig from types/start.rs (stopping uses same
//! config as starting). This file exists for structural parity only.

// No unique types - stop uses HttpDaemonConfig from types/start.rs
