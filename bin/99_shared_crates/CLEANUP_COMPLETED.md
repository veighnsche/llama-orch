# Shared Crates Cleanup - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-10-09T23:47:00+02:00  
**Team:** TEAM-027  
**Status:** ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up shared crates based on user feedback:
- ✅ Deleted 2 obsolete crates
- ✅ Renamed pool-core → hive-core
- ✅ Kept auth-min (security infrastructure)
- ✅ All builds passing

---

## Actions Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Deleted Obsolete Crates

```bash
rm -rf bin/shared-crates/pool-registry-types
rm -rf bin/shared-crates/orchestrator-core
```

**Verification:**
```bash
$ ls bin/shared-crates/ | grep -E "pool-registry-types|orchestrator-core"
# (no output - successfully deleted)
```

### ✅ Task 2: Renamed pool-core → hive-core

**Steps completed:**
1. ✅ Renamed directory: `mv bin/shared-crates/pool-core bin/shared-crates/hive-core`
2. ✅ Updated `hive-core/Cargo.toml`: `name = "hive-core"`
3. ✅ Updated workspace `Cargo.toml`: Removed pool-registry-types, orchestrator-core, renamed pool-core
4. ✅ Updated `rbee-hive/Cargo.toml`: `hive-core = { path = "../shared-crates/hive-core" }`
5. ✅ Updated imports in `rbee-hive/src/commands/models.rs`
6. ✅ Updated imports in `rbee-hive/src/commands/worker.rs`

**Verification:**
```bash
$ cargo build --bin rbee-hive
   Compiling hive-core v0.1.0
   Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.15s
```

### ✅ Task 3: Decided on auth-min

**Decision:** KEEP ✅

**Rationale:**
- Timing-safe token comparison (prevents CWE-208 timing attacks)
- Token fingerprinting for safe logging
- Bearer token parsing (RFC 6750 compliant)
- Integrates with secrets-management
- Security-hardened with strict Clippy rules
- **Future use cases:**
  - rbee-hive ↔ llm-worker-rbee authentication
  - queen-rbee ↔ rbee-hive authentication
  - rbee-keeper CLI authentication
  - Production deployments (non-loopback binds)

---

## Final State

### ✅ Active Shared Crates (11 total)

**Currently Used:**
1. ✅ worker-registry (new, TEAM-027)
2. ✅ hive-core (renamed from pool-core)
3. ✅ gpu-info
4. ✅ narration-core (used by llm-worker-rbee)
5. ✅ narration-macros

**Good Infrastructure for Future:**
6. ✅ auth-min - Security primitives
7. ✅ audit-logging - Production logging
8. ✅ secrets-management - Secure token storage
9. ✅ input-validation - Production validation
10. ✅ deadline-propagation - Performance optimization

**BDD Subcrates:**
- audit-logging/bdd
- input-validation/bdd
- narration-core/bdd
- secrets-management/bdd

### ❌ Deleted Crates (2 total)

1. ❌ pool-registry-types - Replaced by worker-registry
2. ❌ orchestrator-core - Old architecture

---

## Build Verification

```bash
$ cargo build --bin rbee-hive --bin rbee
   Compiling worker-registry v0.1.0
   Compiling hive-core v0.1.0
   Compiling rbee-keeper v0.1.0
   Compiling rbee-hive v0.1.0
   Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s)

$ cargo test --bin rbee-hive --bin rbee
   test result: ok. 10 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored (rbee-hive)
   test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored (rbee-keeper)
```

✅ **All builds and tests passing**
