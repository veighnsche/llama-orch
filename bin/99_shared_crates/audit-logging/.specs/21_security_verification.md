## 5. Known Limitations & Mitigations

### 5.1 Platform Mode Not Implemented ⚠️ DOCUMENTED

**Limitation**: Platform mode signing (HMAC/Ed25519) not implemented.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Platform mode is **optional feature** (not enabled by default)
- ✅ Local mode is fully secure and production-ready
- ✅ Clearly marked with `todo!()` (would fail at compile if enabled)
- ✅ Documented in SECURITY_AUDIT.md

**Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (optional feature, local mode is production-ready)

---

### 5.2 Query Module Not Implemented ⚠️ DOCUMENTED

**Limitation**: Query and verification functions not implemented.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Query module is **not exposed in public API**
- ✅ Does not affect core audit logging security
- ✅ Hash chain verification is implemented
- ✅ Clearly marked with `todo!()`

**Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (not security-critical, implementation complete for core)

---

### 5.3 Streaming Hash Verification ⚠️ PLANNED

**Limitation**: Hash chain verification loads entire file into memory.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Current implementation works for reasonable file sizes
- ✅ Streaming verification planned (ROBUSTNESS_ANALYSIS.md #6)
- ✅ Not a security vulnerability, just a scalability concern

**Status**: ⚠️ ENHANCEMENT PLANNED (not blocking production)

---

### 5.4 Disk Space Monitoring (Windows) ⚠️ PLATFORM-SPECIFIC

**Limitation**: Disk space monitoring only implemented on Unix.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Core functionality works on all platforms
- ✅ Unix/Linux (including CachyOS) fully supported
- ✅ Windows still writes events, just no disk space check
- ✅ Conditional compilation prevents crashes

**Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (Unix fully supported, Windows degrades gracefully)
