# ⚠️ NOT FOR COMPLIANCE/AUDIT LOGGING

**If you're thinking about compliance, you're in the wrong crate!**

---

## This Crate Is For

🐝 **Cute debugging**  
🐛 **Developer observability**  
🎀 **Human-readable narration**  
💬 **Understanding what's happening**  

---

## This Crate Is NOT For

❌ **GDPR compliance**  
❌ **PCI-DSS compliance**  
❌ **SOC 2 compliance**  
❌ **Security audit trails**  
❌ **Tamper-evident logs**  
❌ **Legal evidence**  

---

## What You're Looking For

### For Compliance/Audit Logging

**Go here instead:** `bin/99_shared_crates/audit-logging/`

That crate provides:
- ✅ Tamper-evident logs (cryptographic hashing)
- ✅ Redaction of sensitive data
- ✅ Compliance-ready format
- ✅ Immutable audit trail
- ✅ GDPR/PCI-DSS/SOC 2 support

---

## Why Narration Doesn't Do Compliance

### 1. No Redaction

Narration shows **everything** because developers need full context:

```rust
NARRATE
    .action("model_load")
    .human("Loading /models/llama-3.1-8b.gguf")  // Full path visible
    .emit();

NARRATE
    .action("inference")
    .human("Prompt: Tell me about bees")  // Full prompt visible
    .emit();
```

**For compliance, you need redaction!**

### 2. No Tamper-Evidence

Narration goes to:
- stderr (can be modified)
- SSE streams (ephemeral)
- Tracing logs (not cryptographically signed)

**For compliance, you need tamper-evident logs!**

### 3. No Guarantees

Narration can be:
- Disabled (MUTE level)
- Filtered (by level)
- Lost (if SSE channel doesn't exist)

**For compliance, you need guaranteed logging!**

## Examples of What NOT To Do

### ❌ DON'T: Use narration for security events

```rust
// WRONG - This should be in audit-logging!
NARRATE
    .action("auth_failure")
    .human(format!("Failed login attempt from {}", ip))
    .emit();
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use narration for access control

```rust
// WRONG - This should be in audit-logging!
NARRATE
    .action("data_access")
    .human(format!("User {} accessed customer data", user_id))
    .emit();
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use narration for financial transactions

```rust
// WRONG - This should be in audit-logging!
NARRATE
    .action("payment")
    .human(format!("Charged ${} to card", amount))
    .emit();
```

---

## What TO Do Instead

### ✅ DO: Use narration for debugging

```rust
// CORRECT - This is what narration is for!
NARRATE
    .action("model_load")
    .human("🐝 The worker bee loaded the model successfully")
    .cute("The model whispered: 'I'm ready!' 🎀")
    .emit();
```

### ✅ DO: Use audit-logging for compliance

```rust
// CORRECT - Use audit-logging for security events!
use audit_logging::{AuditLog, AuditEvent};

AuditLog::record(AuditEvent {
    event_type: "auth.failure",
    actor: fingerprint_ip(&ip),  // Redacted
    timestamp: Utc::now(),
    details: json!({ "reason": "invalid_password" }),
    previous_hash: get_last_hash(),
});
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Are you logging this for...

├─ Debugging? → Use narration-core ✅
├─ Compliance? → Use audit-logging ✅
├─ Security? → Use audit-logging ✅
├─ Legal evidence? → Use audit-logging ✅
└─ Cute messages? → Use narration-core ✅
```

## Still Not Sure?

Ask yourself:

1. **Would a lawyer care about this log?**  
   → If YES: Use `audit-logging`  
   → If NO: Use `narration-core`

2. **Do I need to prove this happened in court?**  
   → If YES: Use `audit-logging`  
   → If NO: Use `narration-core`

3. **Is this for GDPR/PCI-DSS/SOC 2?**  
   → If YES: Use `audit-logging`  
   → If NO: Use `narration-core`

4. **Do I need to redact sensitive data?**  
   → If YES: Use `audit-logging`  
   → If NO: Use `narration-core`

5. **Is this just to help me debug?**  
   → If YES: Use `narration-core` ✅
