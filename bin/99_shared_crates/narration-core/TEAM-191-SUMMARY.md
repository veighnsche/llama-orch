**Team**: TEAM-191 (The Narration Core Team)  
**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Version**: 0.3.0

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished!

We successfully upgraded narration-core to support all the amazing usage patterns from queen-rbee! 🎉

---

## ✅ What We Delivered

### 1. Actor Constants Added ✨
**File**: `src/lib.rs`

Added queen-rbee actor constants:
```rust
/// Queen-rbee main service (TEAM-191: Added for queen-rbee operations)
pub const ACTOR_QUEEN_RBEE: &str = "👑 queen-rbee";
/// Queen router (job routing and operation dispatch) (TEAM-191: Added for job routing)
pub const ACTOR_QUEEN_ROUTER: &str = "👑 queen-router";
```

**Why**: Queen-rbee was using these actors but they weren't in our taxonomy!

### 2. Action Constants Added 🎯
**File**: `src/lib.rs`

Added 15+ new action constants:

**Job Routing Actions**:
- `ACTION_ROUTE_JOB` - Route job to appropriate handler
- `ACTION_PARSE_OPERATION` - Parse operation payload
- `ACTION_JOB_CREATE` - Create new job

**Hive Management Actions**:
- `ACTION_HIVE_INSTALL` - Install hive
- `ACTION_HIVE_UNINSTALL` - Uninstall hive
- `ACTION_HIVE_START` - Start hive daemon
- `ACTION_HIVE_STOP` - Stop hive daemon
- `ACTION_HIVE_STATUS` - Check hive status
- `ACTION_HIVE_LIST` - List all hives

**System Actions**:
- `ACTION_STATUS` - Get system status
- `ACTION_START` - Start service
- `ACTION_LISTEN` - Listen for connections
- `ACTION_READY` - Service ready
- `ACTION_ERROR` - Error occurred

**Why**: These actions are used throughout queen-rbee!

### 3. Table Formatting Documented 📊
**File**: `README.md`

Added comprehensive documentation for the `.table()` method:
- Usage examples with real code
- Output examples showing beautiful tables
- Feature list (arrays, objects, auto-width, unicode)
- Perfect for status displays and lists!

**Why**: The `.table()` feature is AMAZING but nobody knew about it!

### 4. Version Bumped 🚀

- Updated version from `0.0.0` → `0.3.0`
