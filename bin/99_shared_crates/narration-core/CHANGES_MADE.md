# CHANGES MADE: CRITICAL BUG FIXES

**Created by:** TEAM-204  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** ⚠️ SUPERSEDED - See SECURITY_FIX_GLOBAL_CHANNEL_REMOVED.md

**Note:** This document describes the initial changes which included a security flaw.
The global channel fallback was a privacy hazard and has been removed.

## Files Modified

### 1. `bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/sse_sink.rs`

**Changes:**
- **Line 135-152:** Added fallback logic to `send_to_job()` method
  - When job channel doesn't exist, falls back to global channel
  - Prevents silent narration loss during race conditions
  
- **Line 597-674:** Replaced weak test with two comprehensive tests
  - `test_send_to_nonexistent_job_falls_back_to_global`: Verifies fallback behavior
  - `test_race_condition_narration_before_channel_creation`: Tests actual race condition

**Before:**
```rust
pub fn send_to_job(&self, job_id: &str, event: NarrationEvent) {
    let jobs = self.jobs.lock().unwrap();
    if let Some(tx) = jobs.get(job_id) {
        let _ = tx.send(event);
    }
    // ← Silent drop if channel doesn't exist!
}
```

**After:**
```rust
pub fn send_to_job(&self, job_id: &str, event: NarrationEvent) {
    let jobs = self.jobs.lock().unwrap();
    if let Some(tx) = jobs.get(job_id) {
        let _ = tx.send(event);
    } else {
        // FALLBACK: Send to global to prevent silent loss
        drop(jobs);
        if let Some(global_tx) = self.global.lock().unwrap().as_ref() {
            let _ = global_tx.send(event);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/jobs.rs`

**Changes:**
- **Line 20-29:** Added `JobChannelGuard` drop guard for guaranteed cleanup
- **Line 93:** Instantiate drop guard at function entry
- **Line 95-107:** Handle missing channel gracefully inside single stream
- **Line 145:** Removed manual cleanup (now handled by drop guard)

**Before:**
```rust
let mut sse_rx = sse_sink::subscribe_to_job(&job_id)
    .expect("Job channel not found");  // ← PANIC!

// ... stream handling ...

// Cleanup only in happy path
sse_sink::remove_job_channel(&job_id);
```

**After:**
```rust
// Drop guard ensures cleanup in ALL cases
let _guard = JobChannelGuard { job_id: job_id.clone() };

// Graceful error handling
let sse_rx_opt = sse_sink::subscribe_to_job(&job_id);
let combined_stream = async_stream::stream! {
    let Some(mut sse_rx) = sse_rx_opt else {
        yield Ok(Event::default().data("ERROR: ..."));
        return;
    };
    // ... normal streaming ...
};
// Cleanup happens automatically via drop guard
```

## Tests Added

### Test 1: `test_send_to_nonexistent_job_falls_back_to_global`

**Purpose:** Verify fallback behavior when job channel doesn't exist

**What it tests:**
1. Send event with job_id to non-existent channel
2. Verify event appears in GLOBAL channel
3. Confirm no silent loss

**Result:** ✅ PASS

---

### Test 2: `test_race_condition_narration_before_channel_creation`

**Purpose:** Test actual race condition scenario

**What it tests:**
1. Emit narration BEFORE channel creation → falls back to global
2. Create job channel
3. Emit narration AFTER channel creation → goes to job channel
4. Verify global doesn't receive job-scoped events

**Result:** ✅ PASS

## Files NOT Changed (But Should Be)

### 1. `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs:48`
**Issue:** TODO marker violates mandatory rules
**Fix needed:** Remove TODO or implement worker registry query

### 2. `START_HERE_TEAMS_199_203.md`
**Issue:** Claims thread-local is implemented (it's not)
**Fix needed:** Update to reflect actual implementation

### 3. Architecture docs
**Issue:** Don't reflect fallback behavior
**Fix needed:** Document that narration falls back to global channel

## Git Commit Message (Suggested)

```
fix(narration): critical bug fixes for SSE broadcaster

CRITICAL FIXES:
- Bug #1: Add fallback to global channel (prevents silent loss)
- Bug #4: Replace .expect() with graceful error handling
- Bug #5: Add drop guard for guaranteed cleanup

TESTS ADDED:
- test_send_to_nonexistent_job_falls_back_to_global
- test_race_condition_narration_before_channel_creation

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Thread-local channels not implemented (follow-up needed)
- Remote hive narration goes to global channel (not job-scoped)

Files changed:
- bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/sse_sink.rs
- bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/jobs.rs

Closes: None (architecture gaps remain)
Follow-up: Thread-local implementation or HTTP ingestion needed
```

---

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (This PR)
- ✅ Fix stop-ship bugs (1, 4, 5)
- ✅ Add tests for race conditions
- ✅ Verify compilation and tests

### Phase 2: Documentation (Before Merge)
- [ ] Remove TODO from hive main.rs
- [ ] Update START_HERE docs
- [ ] Add known limitations to architecture docs

### Phase 3: Follow-up (Next PR)
- [ ] Decide: Thread-local vs HTTP vs Accept limitation
- [ ] Implement chosen solution
- [ ] Add E2E test for remote hive narration
