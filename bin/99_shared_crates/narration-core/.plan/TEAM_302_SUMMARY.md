```

---

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. NarrationTestHarness

Provides isolated test environment with:
- In-memory job registry
- Automatic SSE channel creation
- Job submission helpers
- Stream testing utilities

### 2. SSEStreamTester

Assertion helpers for SSE streams:
- `assert_next(action, message)` - Assert next event matches
- `next_event()` - Wait for event with timeout
- `assert_no_more_events()` - Verify no cross-contamination
- `collect_until_done()` - Collect event sequences

### 3. SSE Utilities

Reusable functions for:
- Event sequence assertions
- Field-level assertions
- String channel collection
- Action presence verification

---

## Tests Implemented

### Basic Integration (5 tests)

1. **test_job_creation_with_narration**
   - Creates job and SSE channel
   - Emits narration with job_id
   - Verifies event received via SSE

2. **test_job_narration_isolation**
   - Creates 2 jobs
   - Emits to each job
   - Verifies no cross-contamination

3. **test_sse_channel_cleanup**
   - Verifies receiver can only be taken once
   - Tests channel consumption

4. **test_multiple_events_same_job**
   - Emits 3 events to same job
   - Verifies all received in order

5. **test_narration_without_job_id_dropped**
   - Verifies events without job_id are dropped (security)

### Concurrent Integration (6 tests)

1. **test_10_concurrent_jobs**
   - Creates 10 jobs concurrently
   - Emits to each job from separate tasks
   - Verifies isolation (no cross-contamination)

2. **test_high_frequency_narration**
   - Emits 100 events rapidly
   - Verifies all received

3. **test_job_context_in_nested_tasks**
   - Tests context in spawned tasks
   - Documents that tokio::spawn needs explicit context

4. **test_concurrent_narration_same_job**
   - 5 tasks emitting to same job concurrently
   - Verifies all events received

5. **test_job_registry_concurrent_access**
   - 10 concurrent job creations
   - Verifies thread safety and unique IDs

6. **Utility tests** (in harness module)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Context Propagation

`tokio::spawn` does NOT inherit task-local context. Each spawned task needs explicit context:

```rust
let job_id_clone = job_id.clone();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let ctx = NarrationContext::new().with_job_id(&job_id_clone);
    with_narration_context(ctx, async {
        n!("action", "message");
    }).await;
}).await.unwrap();
```

### 2. Job Isolation

SSE channels are job-scoped. Events without job_id are dropped (security). This prevents privacy leaks between jobs.

### 3. NUC-Friendly Scale

Tests use realistic but small scale:
- 10 concurrent jobs (not 100)
- 100 events per test (not 1000)
- 5 second timeouts (not 30)

---

## Next Steps for TEAM-303

### Ready to Build

1. **Fake Binary Framework**
   - Lightweight fake queen/hive/worker binaries
   - Use test harness as foundation

2. **Multi-Service E2E Tests**
   - Keeper â†’ Queen flows
   - Queen â†’ Hive flows
   - Full stack E2E

3. **Process Capture E2E**
   - Worker stdout â†’ SSE
   - End-to-end verification

### Available Infrastructure

- âœ… Test harness with job registry
- âœ… SSE stream testing helpers
- âœ… Assertion utilities
- âœ… Documentation and examples
- âœ… Proven concurrent testing patterns
