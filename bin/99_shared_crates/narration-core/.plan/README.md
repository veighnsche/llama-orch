## The Transformation

### Before (Current - Verbose & Fragile)

```rust
// 5 lines for every narration:
NARRATE.action("worker_spawn")
    .job_id(&job_id)  // ‚Üê Manual, 100+ times!
    .context("worker-1")  // ‚Üê Custom {0}, {1} system
    .context("GPU-0")
    .human("Spawning worker {0} on device {1}")  // ‚Üê Reinvents format!()
    .emit();  // ‚Üê Always needed

// Problems:
// - Verbose (5 lines average)
// - Fragile SSE (must create channel first)
// - Manual job_id everywhere
// - Custom string replacement
// - Cute/story modes unused
// - Worker startup lost
```

### After (New - Concise & Resilient)

```rust
// 1 line for most cases:
n!("worker_spawn", "Spawning worker {} on device {}", worker_id, device);

// With all 3 narration modes:
n!("worker_spawn",
    human: "Spawning worker {} on device {}",
    cute: "üêù A new worker bee {} is being born on device {}!",
    story: "The hive gently nudged worker {} awake on device {}",
    worker_id, device
);

// Benefits:
// - Concise (1 line for 90% of cases)
// - Resilient (SSE optional)
// - Automatic (job_id from context)
// - Standard (uses Rust's format!())
// - Flexible (3 modes, runtime configurable)
// - Complete (process capture works)
// - SECURE (job-scoped, no privacy leaks)
```

## What Each Phase Does

### Phase 0: API Redesign (TEAM-297)
**Foundation - Everything builds on this!**

- Create `n!()` macro
- Support all 3 narration modes (human, cute, story)
- Remove `.context()` system
- Use Rust's `format!()` directly
- **Result:** 80% less code for simple cases

### Phase 1: SSE Optional + Privacy Fix (TEAM-298)
**Make narration resilient AND secure**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Remove stderr completely from narration-core
- No exploitable code paths (security by design)
- SSE is PRIMARY output (job-scoped, secure)
- Keeper displays via separate SSE subscription
- Multi-tenant isolation (job-scoped only)
- **Result:** Narration never fails + zero attack surface

### Phase 2: Thread-Local Context (TEAM-299)
**Eliminate manual job_id**

- Set context once
- All narration auto-injects job_id
- Remove 100+ manual `.job_id()` calls
- **Result:** Much less boilerplate

### Phase 3: Process Capture (TEAM-300)
**Capture child process narration**

- Worker stdout captured
- Parsed and re-emitted with job_id
- Flows through SSE
- **Result:** Worker startup visible

### Phase 4: Keeper Lifecycle (TEAM-301)
**Complete the flow**

- Keeper displays queen startup
- Keeper displays hive startup (SSH)
- Real-time streaming
- **Result:** End-to-end narration works!

## Critical Rules for All Teams

### 1. Research First, Code Later
Each phase document has a **Research Phase**. You MUST:
- Read all specified files
- Understand current implementation
- Document your findings
- Create research summary
- **ONLY THEN** start coding

### 2. Follow the Handoff Pattern
Each team must create handoff document:
- What you implemented
- How it works
- Test results
- Issues encountered
- Recommendations for next team

### 3. Maintain Backward Compatibility
Phases 0-2 are **non-breaking**:
- Old API continues working
- Gradual migration
- No forced changes

Phases 3-4 are **additive**:
- New functionality
- Optional features
- Can be disabled

### 4. Test Thoroughly
Each phase has verification checklist:
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No regressions
- [ ] Performance OK (< 5% slower)

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 Success
- [ ] `n!()` macro works with all variants
- [ ] 3 narration modes selectable
- [ ] `.context()` system removed
- [ ] Old builder still works

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Narration works without SSE channels
- [ ] Stdout always available
- [ ] No race conditions
- [ ] SSE still works when channel exists

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Thread-local context everywhere
- [ ] 100+ `.job_id()` calls removed
- [ ] Context inherited in tasks
- [ ] SSE routing unchanged

### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] Worker startup flows through SSE
- [ ] Regex parsing correct
- [ ] Hive captures all narration
- [ ] No lost events

### Phase 4 Success
- [ ] Keeper displays queen startup
- [ ] Keeper displays hive startup (SSH)
- [ ] Real-time streaming works
- [ ] Complete end-to-end flow

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Macro Over Builder for Simple Cases
- **Decision:** Add `n!()` macro, keep builder for complex cases
- **Rationale:** 90% of narration is simple, 10% needs full control
- **Result:** Best of both worlds

### 2. Use Rust's format!() Directly
- **Decision:** Remove custom `.context()` and `{0}`, `{1}` system
- **Rationale:** Don't reinvent the wheel
- **Result:** Full format!() features, less code to maintain

### 3. Three Narration Modes Always Available
- **Decision:** Human/Cute/Story modes, runtime configurable
- **Rationale:** Infrastructure exists, make it usable
- **Result:** Users can choose their narration style

### 4. Stdout is Primary, SSE is Bonus
- **Decision:** Always emit to stdout, try SSE if available
- **Rationale:** Narration must never fail
- **Result:** Resilient system

### 5. Thread-Local Context for job_id
- **Decision:** Auto-inject job_id from context
- **Rationale:** Eliminate 100+ manual calls
- **Result:** Much less boilerplate
