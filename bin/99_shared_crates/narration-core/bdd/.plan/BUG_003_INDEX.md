## 📚 Deep Dive Documents

### Investigation Process

**BUG_003_DEEP_INVESTIGATION.md**
- 6 hypotheses tested with experimental validation
- How we questioned assumptions
- The process that led to the breakthrough
- **When to read:** If you want to understand the debugging methodology

**BUG_003_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md**
- Why job_id filtering was wrong
- Why baseline tracking failed
- User's skepticism was justified
- **When to read:** If you want to understand why previous fixes failed

### Original Bug Report

**BUG_003_CAPTURE_ADAPTER_GLOBAL_STATE.md**
- Original problem statement from TEAM-307
- All attempted fixes documented
- Final resolution added by TEAM-308
- **When to read:** For complete historical context

---

## ⚠️ Outdated Documents (For Archaeology Only)

### BUG_003_FIXED.md ❌ OUTDATED
- Documents TEAM-308's FAILED baseline tracking attempt
- Kept for historical purposes
- **DO NOT FOLLOW THIS DOCUMENT**
- See warning at top of file

---

## 📊 Quick Reference

### The Problem
- 18 scenarios failing with "Expected 1 event, got 25"
- Global CaptureAdapter shared across all test scenarios
- Events accumulating from multiple scenarios

### What Didn't Work
1. **TEAM-307:** job_id filtering (defeated test purpose)
2. **TEAM-308:** Baseline tracking (race condition remained)

### The Real Cause
- Cucumber runs with `--concurrency 64` by default
- All scenarios run in PARALLEL
- They ALL share ONE global CaptureAdapter singleton

### The Fix
```rust
// src/main.rs
World::cucumber()
    .max_concurrent_scenarios(1)  // Force sequential
    .run_and_exit("features").await;
```

### The Result
- **Before:** 2 passed, 18 failed
- **After:** 17 passed, 2 failed  
- **Improvement:** 83% (15/18 failures fixed)

## 🔧 For Future Teams

### If BUG-003 Returns

1. **Check:** Is `max_concurrent_scenarios(1)` still in `src/main.rs`?
2. **Verify:** Run with `--concurrency 64` - does it break?
3. **If yes:** The fix was removed, restore it
4. **If no:** This is a different bug, investigate separately

### If You Want Parallel Execution

The current fix forces sequential execution (slower tests).

**Long-term solution:** Implement thread-local CaptureAdapter

```rust
// capture.rs
thread_local! {
    static CAPTURE: RefCell<Vec<CapturedNarration>> = RefCell::new(Vec::new());
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Each thread has isolated storage
- Supports parallel execution (faster)
- No race conditions

**Effort:** ~2 hours

**See:** BUG_003_BREAKTHROUGH.md "Option 2: Thread-Local CaptureAdapter"

## 🎓 Lessons for Future Debugging

### 1. Question Framework Defaults
- Cucumber doesn't run scenarios sequentially (default concurrency=64)
- Always check framework defaults

### 2. Treat Root Cause, Not Symptoms
- job_id filtering = treating symptom
- Baseline tracking = treating symptom  
- Parallel execution = root cause

### 3. Use Experimental Validation
- The breakthrough came from testing `--concurrency 1`
- Don't just theorize, test your hypotheses

### 4. Document Everything
- Future teams saved hours by reading our investigation
- Code comments at fix location are mandatory
- Follow debugging-rules.md

### 5. Listen to User Skepticism
- User said "be skeptical about this fix"
- User said "global state sounds like an issue"
- User said "find the real solution"
- **User was 100% right**

### 6. NEVER Claim "Fixed" Without Testing
- **Critical mistake almost made:** Wrote docs claiming "FIXED" before verifying
- User caught it: "You have no idea if it worked. You got duped."
- **Rule:** Test WITHOUT fix, test WITH fix, toggle to prove causation
- **THEN** write documentation with verification results
- Claiming "fixed" without testing is just another false lead
