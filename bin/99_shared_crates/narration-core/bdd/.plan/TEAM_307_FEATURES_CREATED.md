# TEAM-307: BDD Features Created

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FEATURES CREATED  
**Team:** TEAM-307

---

## Summary

Created comprehensive BDD feature files covering ALL behaviors (not just failures) of the narration system.

**Total:** 4 new feature files with 90+ scenarios

---

## Features Created

### 1. context_propagation.feature ✅

**Scenarios:** 18 scenarios

**Coverage:**
- Basic context injection (job_id, correlation_id, actor)
- Context propagation across async boundaries
- Context isolation between tasks
- Context with async primitives (select!, timeout, channels)
- Deep nesting (5 levels)
- Edge cases (empty context, no context)

**Key Scenarios:**
- ✅ job_id auto-injection
- ✅ correlation_id auto-injection
- ✅ Context survives await points
- ✅ Context NOT inherited by tokio::spawn (by design)
- ✅ Nested contexts (inner overrides outer)
- ✅ Context with tokio::select! and tokio::timeout
- ✅ Deep nesting (5 levels)

---

### 2. sse_streaming.feature ✅

**Scenarios:** 18 scenarios

**Coverage:**
- SSE channel lifecycle (create, emit, receive)
- Signal markers ([DONE], [ERROR], [CANCELLED])
- Event ordering and high-frequency events
- Job isolation
- Channel cleanup
- Backpressure handling
- Late/early subscribers
- Error handling

**Key Scenarios:**
- ✅ Create SSE channel for job
- ✅ [DONE] signal on completion
- ✅ [ERROR] signal on failure
- ✅ [CANCELLED] signal on cancellation
- ✅ Multiple events in order
- ✅ High-frequency events (100 events)
- ✅ Concurrent jobs isolated
- ✅ Backpressure when client is slow

---

### 3. job_lifecycle.feature ✅

**Scenarios:** 22 scenarios

**Coverage:**
- Job creation (unique IDs, custom IDs)
- Job execution (success, with context)
- Job streaming via SSE
- Job completion (success, with result data)
- Job failure (error handling, narration capture)
- Job timeout
- Job cancellation (running, queued, completed)
- Job cleanup (after completion, after failure)
- Multiple concurrent jobs

**Key Scenarios:**
- ✅ Create job with unique ID
- ✅ Execute job successfully
- ✅ Stream job results via SSE
- ✅ Job completes with result data
- ✅ Job fails with error
- ✅ Job times out
- ✅ Cancel running/queued job
- ✅ Cannot cancel completed job
- ✅ Multiple jobs execute concurrently

---

### 4. failure_scenarios.feature ✅

**Scenarios:** 32 scenarios

**Coverage:**
- Network failures (connection refused, timeout, partial failure)
- SSE stream failures (disconnect, reconnection)
- Service crashes (worker crash, crash during emission)
- Timeout scenarios (execution, SSE read, context operation)
- Resource exhaustion (channel full, too many jobs, large messages)
- Invalid input (null bytes, invalid UTF-8, empty messages)
- State corruption (invalid transitions, duplicate IDs)
- Race conditions (concurrent access, cancel during emission)
- Recovery (transient failures, cascading failures)
- Edge cases (no narration, high frequency, system restart)

**Key Scenarios:**
- ✅ Handle connection refused gracefully
- ✅ Handle network timeout gracefully
- ✅ SSE stream disconnects during narration
- ✅ Worker process crashes
- ✅ Job execution timeout
- ✅ Channel full (backpressure)
- ✅ Too many concurrent jobs (1000)
- ✅ Very large message (1MB)
- ✅ Narration with null bytes/invalid UTF-8
- ✅ Concurrent access to same job
- ✅ System recovers after transient failure
- ✅ Extremely high frequency (1000 events/sec)

## What's Tested

### ✅ Happy Path Behaviors

1. **Context Injection** - Automatic job_id, correlation_id, actor injection
2. **Context Propagation** - Across async boundaries, tasks, channels
3. **SSE Streaming** - Channel creation, event emission, client subscription
4. **Signal Markers** - [DONE], [ERROR], [CANCELLED]
5. **Job Creation** - Unique IDs, custom IDs
6. **Job Execution** - Success, with context, with narration
7. **Job Completion** - Success, with results
8. **Job Cleanup** - Resource cleanup after completion/failure

### ✅ Failure Scenarios

1. **Network Failures** - Connection refused, timeout, partial failure
2. **Stream Failures** - Disconnect, reconnection, multiple disconnects
3. **Service Crashes** - Worker crash, crash during emission
4. **Timeouts** - Execution timeout, read timeout, context timeout
5. **Resource Exhaustion** - Channel full, too many jobs, large messages
6. **Invalid Input** - Null bytes, invalid UTF-8, empty messages
7. **State Corruption** - Invalid transitions, duplicate IDs
8. **Race Conditions** - Concurrent access, cancel during emission

### ✅ Edge Cases

1. **Empty Context** - No fields set
2. **No Context** - Narration without context
3. **Late Subscriber** - Subscribe after events emitted
4. **Early Subscriber** - Subscribe before events emitted
5. **No Narration** - Job with no narration
6. **High Frequency** - 1000 events/sec
7. **Deep Nesting** - 5 levels of async calls
8. **System Restart** - Cleanup after restart

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Existing Features (Update)

Need to update existing features for n!() macro:
- [ ] cute_mode.feature
- [ ] story_mode.feature
- [ ] levels.feature
- [ ] worker_orcd_integration.feature

### Phase 2: Additional Features (Create)

Optional features for complete coverage:
- [ ] process_capture.feature (worker stdout capture)
- [ ] multi_service_flow.feature (keeper → queen → hive → worker)
- [ ] edge_cases.feature (additional boundary conditions)

### Phase 3: Step Definitions (Implement)

Need to implement step definitions for all scenarios:
- [ ] context_steps.rs
- [ ] sse_steps.rs
- [ ] job_steps.rs
- [ ] failure_steps.rs
- [ ] Update narration_steps.rs

### Phase 4: Run & Verify

- [ ] Implement all step definitions
- [ ] Run all scenarios
- [ ] Fix any failures
- [ ] Verify 100% pass rate
