---

## Results

### After Part 1
```
126 scenarios (24 passed, 96 skipped, 6 failed)
515 steps (413 passed, 96 skipped, 6 failed)
```

### After Part 2
```
126 scenarios (31 passed, 88 skipped, 7 failed)
528 steps (433 passed, 88 skipped, 7 failed)
```

### Improvement (Part 2)
- âœ… **+7 scenarios passing** (24 â†’ 31)
- âœ… **-8 scenarios skipped** (96 â†’ 88)
- âœ… **+20 steps passing** (413 â†’ 433)
- âœ… **-8 steps skipped** (96 â†’ 88)

### Cumulative Improvement (Parts 1 + 2)
- âœ… **+14 scenarios passing** (17 â†’ 31, +82%)
- âœ… **-19 scenarios skipped** (107 â†’ 88, -18%)
- âœ… **+59 steps passing** (374 â†’ 433, +16%)
- âœ… **-19 steps skipped** (107 â†’ 88, -18%)

## Steps Implemented (14 total)

### File: `src/steps/story_mode_extended.rs` (NEW - 270 LOC)

**WHEN Steps (4):**
1. `I emit narration with n!("check", story: "...")` - Story narration with n!()
2. `I emit narration with n!("dialogue", story: "...") in context` - Story with context
3. `I narrate with story field "..."` - Direct story field narration
4. `I narrate with story field that is 200 characters long` - Long story field

**THEN Steps (10):**
5. `the captured narration should include story field` - Assert story exists
6. `the story field should contain "..."` - Assert story contains text
7. `the story field should not contain "..."` - Assert story doesn't contain text
8. `the story field should be absent` - Assert story is None
9. `the story field should be present` - Assert story is Some
10. `the story field length should be at most N` - Assert story length
11. `both cute and story fields should be present` - Assert both modes
12. `all three narration modes should be present` - Assert human+cute+story
13. `event N story field should contain "..."` - Assert specific event's story
14. `the story field should include correlation_id "..."` - Assert correlation tracking

## Implementation Details

### Story Mode Support

Story mode enables dialogue-based narration:
```gherkin
When I emit narration with n!("check", story: "\"Do you have 2GB VRAM?\" asked orchestratord. \"Yes!\" replied pool-managerd.")
Then the story field should contain "asked orchestratord"
And the story field should contain "replied pool-managerd"
```

### Context Integration

Story mode works with narration contexts:
```gherkin
Given a narration context with job_id "job-story-123"
When I emit narration with n!("dialogue", story: "\"Starting job!\" announced the system.") in context
Then event 1 should have job_id "job-story-123"
And the story field should contain "announced the system"
```

### Multi-Mode Narration

All three modes can be used together:
```gherkin
When I narrate with:
  | field  | value                                    |
  | human  | Checking capacity across all pools       |
  | cute   | Orchestratord asks everyone nicely! ðŸŽ€   |
  | story  | "Who has capacity?" asked orchestratord. |
Then all three narration modes should be present
```

### Redaction Support

Story fields support automatic redaction:
```gherkin
When I narrate with story field "\"Here's the token: Bearer abc123\" said auth-service."
Then the story field should contain "[REDACTED]"
And the story field should not contain "abc123"
```

- âœ… Story narration with context
- âœ… Story mode is optional
- âœ… Story with multiple speakers
- âœ… Story with error dialogue
- âœ… Story with redaction
- âœ… Story narration length guideline
- âœ… Triple narration (human + cute + story)

## Total Implementation Summary

### Combined (Parts 1 + 2)

**Files Created:**
1. `src/steps/cute_mode.rs` (250 LOC) - 16 steps
2. `src/steps/story_mode_extended.rs` (270 LOC) - 14 steps

**Total:** 30 step functions, 520 LOC

**Test Results:**
- Started: 17 passed, 107 skipped, 2 failed
- Now: 31 passed, 88 skipped, 7 failed
- **Improvement: +82% more scenarios passing**

---

## Remaining Work

### Still Skipped: 88 steps

These are in:
- `failure_scenarios.feature` (~30 steps) - Network failures, timeouts
- `job_lifecycle.feature` (~20 steps) - Job state transitions
- `sse_streaming.feature` (~15 steps) - SSE channel tests
- `worker_orcd_integration.feature` (~23 steps) - Worker integration

### Failures: 7 scenarios

These need investigation - they were previously skipped, now running.

## Code Quality

### âœ… Follows Engineering Rules
- All functions have TEAM-308 signature in file headers
- No TODO markers
- Proper error messages
- Code comments explain behavior

### âœ… Compilation
```bash
cargo build -p observability-narration-core-bdd --bin bdd-runner
# Result: SUCCESS (warnings only)
```

### âœ… Testing
```bash
cd bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/bdd
cargo run --bin bdd-runner
# Result: 31 passed, 88 skipped, 7 failed
```

---

## Files Modified

1. âœ… **NEW:** `src/steps/story_mode_extended.rs` (270 LOC)
   - 14 step functions
   - Supports story field in all scenarios
   - Multi-mode narration support

2. âœ… **MODIFIED:** `src/steps/mod.rs`
   - Added `pub mod story_mode_extended;`

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build -p observability-narration-core-bdd --bin bdd-runner

# Run all tests
cd bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/bdd
cargo run --bin bdd-runner

# Run only story_mode tests
cargo run --bin bdd-runner -- --input "features/story_mode.feature"

# Check improvement
cargo run --bin bdd-runner 2>&1 | grep "\[Summary\]" -A 3
```
