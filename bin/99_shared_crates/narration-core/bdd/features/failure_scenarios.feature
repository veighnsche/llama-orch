# TEAM-307: Failure Scenarios Feature
# Tests system behavior under adverse conditions

Feature: Failure Scenarios
  As a production system
  I want to handle failures gracefully
  So that the system remains stable under adverse conditions

  Background:
    Given the narration capture adapter is installed
    And the capture buffer is empty

  # ============================================================================
  # Network Failures
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Handle connection refused gracefully
    Given a job client configured for "http://localhost:9999"
    When I attempt to submit a job
    Then the operation should fail with connection error
    And no panic should occur
    And the error should be user-friendly

  Scenario: Handle network timeout gracefully
    Given a job client with 100ms timeout
    And a slow server that delays 200ms
    When I attempt to submit a job
    Then the operation should fail with timeout error
    And no panic should occur
    And resources should be cleaned up

  Scenario: Handle partial network failure
    Given a job with ID "job-partial-fail"
    And an SSE stream is active
    When the network connection drops mid-stream
    Then the client should detect disconnection
    And the client should handle it gracefully
    And no panic should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # SSE Stream Failures
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: SSE stream disconnects during narration
    Given a job with ID "job-sse-disconnect"
    And an SSE client is subscribed
    When narration is emitted
    And the SSE client disconnects
    And more narration is emitted
    Then the system should handle disconnect gracefully
    And no panic should occur
    And new clients can still subscribe

  Scenario: SSE stream reconnection works
    Given a job with ID "job-sse-reconnect"
    And an SSE client was subscribed and disconnected
    When a new SSE client subscribes
    And narration is emitted
    Then the new client should receive narration
    And the system should work normally

  Scenario: Multiple SSE clients disconnect simultaneously
    Given a job with ID "job-multi-disconnect"
    And 10 SSE clients are subscribed
    When all clients disconnect simultaneously
    Then the system should handle all disconnects
    And no panic should occur
    And resources should be cleaned up

  # ============================================================================
  # Service Crashes
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Worker process crashes during execution
    Given a job with ID "job-worker-crash"
    And a worker process is running
    When the worker process crashes
    Then the crash should be detected
    And narration before crash should be preserved
    And the job should be marked as failed
    And the error should indicate crash

  Scenario: Service crash during narration emission
    Given a job with ID "job-emit-crash"
    When narration is being emitted
    And a simulated crash occurs
    Then the system should recover gracefully
    And no data corruption should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # Timeout Scenarios
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Job execution timeout
    Given a job with ID "job-exec-timeout"
    And a timeout of 1 second
    When the job runs for 5 seconds
    Then the job should be cancelled
    And the job state should be "Failed"
    And the error should mention "Timeout after"

  Scenario: SSE stream read timeout
    Given a job with ID "job-sse-timeout"
    And an SSE client with 1 second read timeout
    When no events are emitted for 2 seconds
    Then the client should timeout gracefully
    And no panic should occur

  Scenario: Context operation timeout
    Given a narration context with job_id "job-ctx-timeout"
    When I perform a long operation with timeout
    And the operation exceeds timeout
    Then the timeout should be detected
    And context should remain valid
    And no panic should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # Resource Exhaustion
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Channel full (backpressure)
    Given a job with ID "job-channel-full"
    And an SSE channel with small buffer (10 events)
    When I emit 100 events rapidly
    And the client is slow to consume
    Then backpressure should be applied
    And no events should be lost
    And the system should remain stable

  Scenario: Too many concurrent jobs
    When I create 1000 jobs simultaneously
    Then the system should handle the load
    And jobs should be queued if necessary
    And no panic should occur
    And memory usage should be reasonable

  Scenario: Very large narration message (1MB)
    Given a job with ID "job-large-message"
    When I emit narration with 1MB message
    Then the system should handle it gracefully
    And the message should be truncated if necessary
    And no panic should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # Invalid Input
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Narration with null bytes
    Given a job with ID "job-null-bytes"
    When I emit narration containing null bytes
    Then the system should handle it gracefully
    And the narration should be sanitized
    And no panic should occur

  Scenario: Narration with invalid UTF-8
    Given a job with ID "job-invalid-utf8"
    When I emit narration with invalid UTF-8 bytes
    Then the system should handle it gracefully
    And the narration should be sanitized or rejected
    And no panic should occur

  Scenario: Empty narration message
    Given a job with ID "job-empty-message"
    When I emit narration with empty message
    Then the narration should be accepted
    And the empty message should be preserved
    And no panic should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # State Corruption
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Job state transition invalid
    Given a job with ID "job-invalid-transition"
    And the job is in "Completed" state
    When I attempt to transition to "Running" state
    Then the transition should be rejected
    And the job should remain in "Completed" state
    And an error should be logged

  Scenario: Duplicate job_id
    Given a job with ID "job-duplicate"
    When I attempt to create another job with ID "job-duplicate"
    Then the second creation should be handled gracefully
    And either it should fail or use existing job
    And no panic should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # Race Conditions
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Concurrent access to same job
    Given a job with ID "job-concurrent"
    When 10 threads access the job simultaneously
    And each thread emits narration
    Then all narration should be captured
    And no race conditions should occur
    And no data should be lost

  Scenario: Job cancelled while emitting narration
    Given a job with ID "job-cancel-race"
    And the job is emitting narration
    When the job is cancelled mid-emission
    Then the cancellation should be handled gracefully
    And partial narration should be preserved
    And no panic should occur

  # ============================================================================
  # Recovery
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: System recovers after transient failure
    Given a job with ID "job-recovery"
    When a transient network error occurs
    And the error is resolved
    And I retry the operation
    Then the operation should succeed
    And the system should work normally

  Scenario: Cleanup after cascading failures
    Given multiple jobs are running
    When a cascading failure occurs
    Then each job should fail independently
    And all resources should be cleaned up
    And the system should remain stable

  # ============================================================================
  # Edge Cases
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Job with no narration
    Given a job with ID "job-no-narration"
    When the job executes without emitting narration
    Then the job should complete normally
    And the SSE stream should only have "[DONE]"

  Scenario: Extremely high frequency narration (1000 events/sec)
    Given a job with ID "job-high-freq"
    When I emit 1000 narration events per second
    Then the system should handle the load
    And all events should be captured
    And performance should remain acceptable

  Scenario: Job cleanup after system restart
    Given jobs were running before restart
    When the system restarts
    Then orphaned resources should be cleaned up
    And the system should start fresh
    And no zombie jobs should remain
