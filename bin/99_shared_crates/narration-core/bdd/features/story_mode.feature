# TEAM-307: Updated for n!() macro and context propagation
Feature: Story Mode Narration
  As a developer debugging distributed systems
  I want dialogue-based narration
  So that multi-service interactions are crystal clear

  Background:
    Given the narration capture adapter is installed
    And the capture buffer is empty

  Scenario: Basic story narration with n!() macro
    When I emit narration with n!("check", story: "\"Do you have 2GB VRAM?\" asked orchestratord. \"Yes!\" replied pool-managerd.")
    Then the captured narration should include story field
    And the story field should contain "asked orchestratord"
    And the story field should contain "replied pool-managerd"

  Scenario: Story narration with context
    Given a narration context with job_id "job-story-123"
    When I emit narration with n!("dialogue", story: "\"Starting job!\" announced the system.") in context
    Then the captured narration should have 1 event
    And event 1 should have job_id "job-story-123"
    And the story field should contain "announced the system"

  Scenario: Story mode is optional
    When I narrate without story field
    Then the captured narration should have 1 event
    And the story field should be absent
