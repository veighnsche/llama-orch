//! Rbee-hive heartbeat handling
//!
//! TEAM-164: Binary-specific heartbeat logic for rbee-hive
//! TEAM-218: Investigated Oct 22, 2025 - STUB with TODOs, not wired to main.rs
//!
//! **What lives here:**
//! - Hive receives heartbeats from workers
//! - Hive sends aggregated heartbeats to queen
//! - Updates worker registry with heartbeat data
//!
//! **What lives in shared crate:**
//! - Heartbeat types (WorkerHeartbeatPayload, HiveHeartbeatPayload, etc.)
//! - Heartbeat traits
//! - Common heartbeat logic
