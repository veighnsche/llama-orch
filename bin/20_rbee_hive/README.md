# rbee-hive

**Status:** ðŸš§ STUB (Created by TEAM-135)  
**Purpose:** Daemon for managing LLM worker instances on a single machine

## Overview

rbee-hive is a daemon that manages multiple LLM worker instances on a single machine.

**CRITICAL:** This is a DAEMON ONLY binary. NO CLI functionality!

## Binary Structure

```
bin/20_rbee_hive/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs          (Entry point - daemon args only)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ http_server.rs   (HTTP routes & API - IN BINARY)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib.rs           (Re-exports from crates)
â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml
```

**IMPORTANT:** HTTP server entry point is implemented DIRECTLY in the binary,
not as a separate crate.
