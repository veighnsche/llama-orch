# execution-planner

**Generates optimal execution plans within worker's GPU constraints**

Receives inference requests and determines the most efficient execution strategy given available VRAM, current load, and model configuration. Returns plans to pool-managerd for scheduling decisions.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Evaluate if request fits in available VRAM
- Estimate execution time based on current load
- Report available replica slots
- Propose execution plan (which replica, estimated latency)
