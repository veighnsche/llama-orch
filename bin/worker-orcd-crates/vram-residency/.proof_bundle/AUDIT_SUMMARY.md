# AUTOGENERATED: Proof Bundle

# Audit Summary — vram-residency Proof Bundle

**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Auditor**: proof-bundle team  
**Requested by**: User

---

## TL;DR

**Finding**: vram-residency has **excellent code** but **zero proof bundle evidence**

**Impact**: Human auditors **cannot verify** any security or functional claims

**Action**: Implement comprehensive proof bundle generation (~40 hours)

---

## The Problem

### What We Found

1. **Empty proof bundle directory**
   - `.proof_bundle/unit/` is completely empty
   - No test artifacts
   - No evidence files
   - No logs

2. **Custom generator not integrated**
   - `tests/proof_bundle_generator.rs` exists but not used
   - Doesn't use standardized `test-harness/proof-bundle` library
   - Only covers 6 basic tests (out of 112 total)

3. **Missing critical evidence**
   - No cryptographic operation logs
   - No VRAM allocation traces
   - No security validation evidence
   - No performance measurements
   - No GPU operation logs

4. **Insufficient explanations**
   - Current output is terse ("✅ PASS")
   - No context for non-experts
   - No threat model coverage
   - No compliance mapping

5. **No provenance**
   - No git commit SHA
   - No build environment details
   - No reproducibility instructions

## Why This Matters

### Human Auditor Perspective

**Current state**: "Trust us, we tested it"
- ❌ Cannot verify claims
- ❌ Cannot assess security properties
- ❌ Cannot reproduce results
- ❌ Cannot trace requirements to tests

**Needed state**: "Here's irrefutable evidence"
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Rich explanations
- ✅ Clear threat model coverage
- ✅ Compliance mapping
- ✅ Full provenance

---

## What Good Looks Like

### Example: Comprehensive Evidence

**Bad** (current):
```
✅ PASS: Model sealed successfully
```

**Good** (needed):
```
## Test: Model Sealing (Cryptographic Integrity)

**Purpose**: Verify that model data loaded into VRAM is cryptographically
sealed with HMAC-SHA256 to prevent tampering.

**Security Property**: Integrity protection (TIER 1 requirement)

**Threat Model Coverage**:
- ✅ Prevents model corruption attacks
- ✅ Detects unauthorized model modifications
- ✅ Ensures inference uses verified model weights

**Test Execution**:
1. Created 1MB test model (1,000,000 bytes)
2. Loaded into VRAM on GPU device 0
3. Computed SHA-256 digest: a1b2c3d4...
4. Generated HMAC-SHA256 seal: e5f6g7h8...
5. Verified seal signature matches

**Result**: ✅ PASS

**Evidence**:
- Shard ID: abc123-def456-ghi789
- VRAM allocation: 1,000,000 bytes
- GPU device: 0 (RTX 3090)
- Digest: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8... (64 hex chars)
- Signature: e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2... (64 hex chars)
- Sealed at: 2025-10-02T10:18:33Z
- Verification: SUCCESS (timing-safe comparison)

**Performance**:
- Seal operation: 1.8ms
- Verification: 0.3ms

**Compliance**:
- ✅ GDPR Art. 32 (Integrity protection)
- ✅ SOC2 CC6.1 (Cryptographic controls)
- ✅ ISO 27001 A.10.1.1 (Cryptographic policy)
```

**Purpose**: Make it immediately obvious that evidence is missing

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Migrate to Standard Library

**Action**: Replace custom generator with `test-harness/proof-bundle`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic cleanup (only latest bundle)
- ✅ Standardized structure
- ✅ NDJSON with metadata
- ✅ Proper run_id format
- ✅ Environment variable support

**Effort**: 8-10 hours

---

### Priority 2: Generate Rich Evidence

**Action**: Create comprehensive NDJSON logs

**Files needed**:
- `crypto_validation.jsonl`
- `policy_enforcement.jsonl`
- `cuda_operations.jsonl`
- `bounds_checking.jsonl`
- `input_validation.jsonl`
- `performance.jsonl`

**Effort**: 12-16 hours

---

### Priority 3: Add Rich Explanations

**Action**: Generate human-readable reports

**Files needed**:
- `test_report.md` (with detailed explanations)
- `spec_coverage.md` (requirements traceability)
- `compliance_matrix.md` (GDPR/SOC2/ISO mapping)

**Effort**: 8-12 hours

---

### Priority 4: Add Provenance

**Action**: Capture build and environment details

**Files needed**:
- `metadata.json` (git SHA, versions, environment)
- `build_log.txt` (full build output)
- `environment.json` (GPU details, CUDA version)

**Effort**: 6-8 hours

---

## Total Effort

**Estimated**: 34-46 hours (~1 week of focused work)

**Phases**:
1. Foundation (Week 1) - 8-10 hours
2. Rich Evidence (Week 2) - 12-16 hours
3. Human-Readable Reports (Week 3) - 8-12 hours
4. Automation (Week 4) - 6-8 hours

---

## Impact

### Before
- ⚠️ Empty proof bundle directory
- ⚠️ No evidence to verify claims
- ⚠️ LOW human auditor confidence
- ⚠️ "Trust us, we tested it"

### After
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Rich explanations for non-experts
- ✅ HIGH human auditor confidence
- ✅ "Here's irrefutable evidence with full provenance"
