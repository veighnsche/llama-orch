# Test Progress Messages

This document explains the progress messages added to long-running tests.

## Overview

To improve the testing experience, progress messages have been added to:
1. Show what's happening during long tests
2. Provide time estimates
3. Report progress during execution

## Test Duration Summary

When you run `cargo test -p vram-residency`, you'll see:

### Initial Summary (from test_runner)

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  VRAM Residency - Dual-Mode Testing                      ║

📋 Testing Strategy:
   1. ✅ Run all tests with MOCK VRAM (always)
   2. 🔍 Detect GPU availability
   3. ✅ Run all tests with REAL CUDA (if GPU found)
   4. ⚠️  Emit warning if no CUDA found

🎮 GPU Status: DETECTED
   → Tests will run in BOTH mock and real CUDA modes
   → Full coverage (100%) will be achieved
   → Expected total duration: 2-3 minutes

⏱️  Test Duration Estimates:
   • Unit tests: ~1 second
   • CUDA kernel tests: ~1 second
   • Dual-mode examples: ~2 seconds
   • Concurrent tests: ~2 seconds
   • Property tests: ~10 seconds (256 cases per property)
   • Stress tests: ~90 seconds (VRAM exhaustion test)
   • Proof bundle: ~1 second

## Long-Running Tests with Progress

### 1. VRAM Exhaustion Test (~90 seconds)

**Test**: `test_seal_until_vram_exhausted`

**Progress Messages**:
```
⏱️  Starting VRAM exhaustion test...
   This test seals 1MB models until VRAM is full
   Expected duration: 30-90 seconds depending on available VRAM
   Progress will be reported every 100 models

   ✓ Sealed 100 models (100 MB) in 5 seconds
   ✓ Sealed 200 models (200 MB) in 10 seconds
   ✓ Sealed 300 models (300 MB) in 15 seconds
   ...
   ✓ VRAM exhausted after sealing 847 models (847 MB)
   Verifying all 847 sealed shards...
   ✓ Verified 100/847 shards
   ✓ Verified 200/847 shards
   ...
   ✅ Test complete in 87 seconds
```

### 2. Dual-Mode Tests (1-2 seconds each)

**Tests**: All tests in `dual_mode_example.rs`

**Progress Messages**:
```
🧪 Running with MOCK VRAM...
   → Testing with mock VRAM
✅ Mock mode: PASSED (0.12s)
🎮 GPU detected: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060
   VRAM: 12 GB
🧪 Running with REAL CUDA...
   → Testing with real CUDA allocations
✅ Real CUDA mode: PASSED (0.18s)
```

### 3. Property-Based Tests (~10 seconds total)

**Tests**: All tests in `robustness_properties.rs`

**Header Message**:
```
Property-Based Robustness Tests

Note: These tests run 256 cases per property by default.
Expected duration: 5-15 seconds total for all property tests.
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Transparency**
- You know what's happening during long waits
- No more wondering if tests are hung

### 2. **Time Estimates**
- Clear expectations for how long tests will take
- Can plan your workflow accordingly

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
- See incremental progress during long tests
- Know how far along the test is

### 4. **Debugging Aid**
- If a test hangs, you can see where it stopped
- Progress messages help identify problematic operations

✅ Real CUDA mode: PASSED (0.18s)

# Property tests show header
Property-Based Robustness Tests
Expected duration: 5-15 seconds total
test result: ok. 13 passed (10.44s)

# Stress test shows detailed progress
⏱️  Starting VRAM exhaustion test...
   ✓ Sealed 100 models (100 MB) in 5 seconds
   ✓ Sealed 200 models (200 MB) in 10 seconds
   ...
   ✅ Test complete in 87 seconds

# Final summary
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ All tests passed in BOTH mock and real CUDA modes
🎯 Full coverage achieved (100%)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Customization

### Adjust Progress Frequency

In `test_seal_until_vram_exhausted`, progress is reported every 100 models:

```rust
if seal_count % 100 == 0 {
    println!("   ✓ Sealed {} models", seal_count);
}
```

Change `100` to report more or less frequently.

### Disable Progress Messages

Run tests with output suppression:

```bash
cargo test -p vram-residency --quiet
```

Or redirect to a file:

```bash
cargo test -p vram-residency > test_output.txt 2>&1
```

## Performance Impact

Progress messages have **negligible performance impact**:
- Only print every 100 iterations (not every operation)
- Use simple string formatting
- No complex calculations
- Overhead: < 0.1% of total test time

## Summary

With these progress messages, you'll always know:
- ✅ What test is running
- ✅ How long it will take
- ✅ How far along it is
- ✅ When it completes

No more mysterious long waits! 🎉
