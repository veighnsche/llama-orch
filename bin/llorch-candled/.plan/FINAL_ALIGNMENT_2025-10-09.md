## 🎯 Key Messages (All Documents Agree)

### 1. Dual Output Architecture
Narration has TWO outputs based on context:
- Lifecycle events → stdout only (no HTTP request)
- Per-request events → stdout + SSE (during HTTP request)

### 2. Not Redundant
Different audiences need different views:
- Pool-manager needs ALL events for monitoring
- User needs per-request events for real-time feedback

### 3. Partial Implementation
Current state:
- ✅ Stdout narration works (21 events)
- ❌ SSE narration missing (8 events should also go to SSE)

### 4. Clear Next Steps
Implementation plan:
1. Add `Narration` to SSE event enum
2. Create SSE channel for narration
3. Modify `narrate()` for dual output
4. Test user sees narration

### 5. Event Counts
All documents agree:
- 13 stdout-only events (worker lifecycle)
- 8 stdout+SSE events (per-request)
- 21 total narration events

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] Add `Narration` variant to `InferenceEvent` enum in `src/http/sse.rs`
- [ ] Create SSE channel infrastructure in `src/http/execute.rs`
- [ ] Add request-local context for SSE sender

### Short-term (Week 2)
- [ ] Modify `narrate()` to check for SSE context
- [ ] Emit narration to SSE when in request context
- [ ] Merge narration stream with token stream

### Medium-term (Week 3)
- [ ] Test user sees narration in real-time
- [ ] Update orchestrator to relay narration
- [ ] Verify pool-manager still captures stdout

### Long-term (Week 4)
- [ ] Create complete OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Generate client libraries
- [ ] Add Swagger UI (optional)
- [ ] Performance testing

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T: "All narration should go to SSE"
**Why**: Worker lifecycle events have no HTTP request yet

### ❌ DON'T: "Stdout and SSE are redundant"
**Why**: Different audiences (pool-manager vs user)

### ❌ DON'T: "Just use stdout for everything"
**Why**: User can't see stdout, needs real-time feedback

### ✅ DO: "Dual output based on context"
**Why**: Lifecycle → stdout, per-request → stdout + SSE

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### User Experience
User sees on their screen:
```
✅ Request validated
🚀 Starting inference (50 tokens)
🍰 Tokenized prompt (7 tokens)
🎯 Generated 10 tokens
🎯 Generated 20 tokens
🎉 Complete! (42 tokens in 250ms)
```

### Pool-Manager Logs
Pool-manager sees in logs:
```
[INFO] worker-gpu0-r1: Starting Candle worker on port 8080
[INFO] worker-gpu0-r1: Initialized CUDA device 0
[INFO] worker-gpu0-r1: Loaded Llama model (7000 MB)
[INFO] worker-gpu0-r1: HTTP server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
[INFO] worker-gpu0-r1: Request validated for job job-123
[INFO] worker-gpu0-r1: Inference completed (42 tokens in 250ms)
```

### Both Are Valuable
- Pool-manager: Operational monitoring, all workers
- User: Real-time feedback, their request only
