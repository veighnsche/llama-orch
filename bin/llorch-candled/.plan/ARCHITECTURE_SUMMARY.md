## 📊 The Simple Truth

### Narration Has TWO Outputs (Not One!)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Worker Lifecycle (13 events)     Per-Request (8 events)    │
│  ├─ Startup                        ├─ Request validated     │
│  ├─ Device init                    ├─ Inference start       │
│  ├─ Model loading                  ├─ Tokenization          │

│  └─ Server start/shutdown          ├─ Token progress        │
│                                    ├─ Inference complete    │
│         ↓                          └─ Errors                │
│                                                              │
│    STDOUT ONLY                     STDOUT + SSE             │
│         ↓                               ↓        ↓          │

│   (monitoring)                    (logs)     Screen        │
│                                                              │

## ✅ What's Implemented

- ✅ **Stdout narration** - All 21 events go to stdout
- ✅ **Correlation IDs** - Propagate through requests
- ✅ **Cute messages** - Delightful debugging
- ✅ **Pool-manager can see** - Worker lifecycle in logs

---

## ❌ What's Missing

- ❌ **SSE narration** - Per-request events don't go to SSE
- ❌ **User can't see** - Narration only in logs, not on screen
- ❌ **Narration event type** - Not defined in SSE enum
- ❌ **Dual output** - `narrate()` only outputs to stdout

---

## 🎯 The Fix

### Change `narrate()` from single output to dual output:

**Current (WRONG)**:
```rust
pub fn narrate(fields: NarrationFields) {
    // Only goes to stdout
    tracing::event!(Level::INFO, ...);
}
```

**Correct (WHAT WE NEED)**:
```rust
pub fn narrate(fields: NarrationFields) {
    // 1. ALWAYS go to stdout (for pool-manager)
    tracing::event!(Level::INFO, ...);
    
    // 2. IF in HTTP request, ALSO go to SSE (for user)
    if let Some(sse_tx) = get_current_sse_sender() {
        sse_tx.send(InferenceEvent::Narration {
            actor: fields.actor.to_string(),
            action: fields.action.to_string(),
            human: fields.human,
            cute: fields.cute,
            // ...
        });
    }
}
```

## 📋 Event Breakdown

### Category 1: Stdout Only (13 events)
**When**: Worker startup/shutdown (NO active HTTP request)  
**Who sees**: Pool-manager only

1. Worker startup
2. CPU device init
3. CUDA device init
4. Metal device init
5. Model load (start)
6. Model load (complete)
7. Callback ready (main)
8. Callback attempt (startup)
9. Callback failed
10. Server start
11. Server bind
12. Bind failed
13. Server shutdown

### Category 2: Stdout + SSE (8 events)
**When**: During `/execute` request (active HTTP connection)  
**Who sees**: Pool-manager (logs) + User (screen)

1. Validation failed
2. Request validated
3. Inference start
4. Tokenization
5. Cache reset
6. Token generation progress
7. Inference complete
8. Inference failed

## 🔍 Why This Matters

### For Pool-Manager
- Needs to see ALL events (lifecycle + per-request)
- Uses stdout logs for monitoring
- Tracks worker health and performance

### For User (Agentic API)
- Needs to see per-request events in real-time
- Wants to know what's happening during inference
- Sees narration on their screen via orchestrator

### For Debugging
- Pool-manager logs: "Worker started, model loaded, server ready"
- User screen: "Starting inference... Tokenizing... Generated 10 tokens... Complete!"

## 🚀 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Stdout Narration ✅ DONE
- [x] Add narration-core dependency
- [x] Create narration constants
- [x] Add 21 narration points
- [x] Correlation ID middleware

### Phase 2: SSE Narration ❌ TODO
- [ ] Add `Narration` variant to `InferenceEvent` enum
- [ ] Create SSE channel in execute handler
- [ ] Store channel in request-local context
- [ ] Modify `narrate()` to check for SSE channel
- [ ] Merge narration events into SSE stream
- [ ] Test user sees narration in real-time

### Phase 3: OpenAPI Spec ❌ TODO
- [ ] Create `openapi.yaml`
- [ ] Include `narration` event type
- [ ] Document event ordering
- [ ] Generate clients

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Not All Narration Goes to SSE
**Worker lifecycle events** (startup, shutdown) have no HTTP request, so they can't go to SSE. They only go to stdout.

### 2. Per-Request Events Need Dual Output
**Inference events** happen during an HTTP request, so they should go to BOTH stdout (for pool-manager) AND SSE (for user).

### 3. This Is Not Redundant
- Pool-manager needs logs for ALL workers (monitoring)
- User needs real-time feedback for THEIR request (UX)
- Different audiences, different needs, both valid

### 4. Correlation IDs Tie It Together
- Same `correlation_id` in stdout logs AND SSE events
- Operators can correlate user requests with backend events
- Complete end-to-end tracing

---

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions (Now Corrected)

### ❌ WRONG: "Narration goes to stdout, SSE is separate"
**Reality**: Some narration goes to BOTH stdout AND SSE.

### ❌ WRONG: "All narration should go to SSE"
**Reality**: Worker lifecycle events can't go to SSE (no HTTP request yet).

### ❌ WRONG: "Stdout and SSE are redundant"
**Reality**: Different audiences (pool-manager vs user), both needed.

### ✅ CORRECT: "Narration has dual output based on context"
- Lifecycle events → stdout only
- Per-request events → stdout + SSE
