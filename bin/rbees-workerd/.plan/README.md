## üéØ Quick Reference

### Current State

**‚úÖ What Works:**
- Narration events emit to stdout (tracing)
- Pool-manager can capture worker lifecycle events
- Correlation IDs propagate
- SSE token stream works
- 25 narration points implemented

**‚ùå What's Missing:**
- Narration events do NOT go to SSE stream
- User cannot see narration in real-time
- Only pool-manager sees narration (in logs)

---

### The Correct Architecture

**Narration has TWO outputs:**

#### 1. Stdout Only (13 events)
**Worker lifecycle events - Pool-manager sees these**

- Worker startup
- Device initialization (CPU/CUDA/Metal)
- Model loading
- Pool-manager callback
- Server start/bind/shutdown

**Why stdout only**: These happen when there's NO active HTTP request.

#### 2. Stdout + SSE (8 events)
**Per-request events - BOTH pool-manager AND user see these**

- Execute request validation
- Inference start
- Tokenization
- Cache reset
- Token generation progress
- Inference complete
- Request errors

**Why dual output**: These happen DURING an HTTP request. Pool-manager needs them for monitoring, user needs them for real-time feedback.

## üîß Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Stdout Narration ‚úÖ
- [x] Add narration-core dependency
- [x] Create narration constants
- [x] Add narration to worker lifecycle (13 events)
- [x] Add narration to inference pipeline (8 events)
- [x] Correlation ID middleware

### Phase 2: SSE Narration ‚ùå
- [ ] Add `Narration` event type to `InferenceEvent` enum
- [ ] Create SSE channel for narration
- [ ] Modify `narrate()` to emit to SSE when in request context
- [ ] Merge narration events into SSE stream
- [ ] Test user can see narration in real-time

### Phase 3: OpenAPI Spec ‚ùå
- [ ] Create `openapi.yaml` with all endpoints
- [ ] Include `narration` SSE event type
- [ ] Generate TypeScript client
- [ ] Generate Python client
- [ ] Add Swagger UI (optional)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### All Documents Are Now Aligned ‚úÖ

All documents have been updated to reflect the correct architecture:
- Narration has **dual output** (stdout + SSE)
- **13 events** go to stdout only (worker lifecycle)
- **8 events** go to both stdout and SSE (per-request)
- User needs to see per-request narration in real-time
- Pool-manager needs to see all narration for monitoring

### No More Confusion

The initial confusion was:
- ‚ùå "Narration goes to stdout, SSE is separate"
- ‚úÖ "Narration goes to BOTH stdout AND SSE (depending on event type)"

All documents now correctly explain this dual-output architecture.
