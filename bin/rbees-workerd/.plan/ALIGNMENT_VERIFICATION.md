# ✅ Document Alignment Verification

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: ✅ **ALL DOCUMENTS ALIGNED**

## 🎯 Core Truth (All Documents Agree)

### Narration Has Dual Output

1. **Stdout Only** (13 events)
   - Worker lifecycle events
   - No active HTTP request
   - Pool-manager sees these

2. **Stdout + SSE** (8 events)
   - Per-request events
   - During active HTTP request
   - Pool-manager AND user see these

## 🔍 Consistency Verification

### All Documents Agree On:

#### Event Counts
- ✅ 13 stdout-only events (worker lifecycle)
- ✅ 8 stdout+SSE events (per-request)
- ✅ 21 total narration events

#### Architecture
- ✅ Dual output based on context
- ✅ Lifecycle events → stdout only
- ✅ Per-request events → stdout + SSE
- ✅ Not redundant, different audiences

#### Implementation Status
- ✅ Stdout narration complete
- ✅ SSE narration missing
- ✅ Correlation IDs working
- ✅ 25 narration points implemented

#### Next Steps
- ✅ Add `Narration` to SSE event enum
- ✅ Create SSE channel
- ✅ Modify `narrate()` for dual output
- ✅ Test user sees narration

## 🎯 Key Messages (Consistent Across All Docs)

### Message 1: Dual Output Architecture
**All documents agree**: Narration has TWO outputs (stdout + SSE), not one.

### Message 2: Context Determines Output
**All documents agree**: Worker lifecycle → stdout only, per-request → stdout + SSE.

### Message 3: Not Redundant
**All documents agree**: Different audiences (pool-manager vs user), both needed.

### Message 4: Partial Implementation
**All documents agree**: Stdout works, SSE missing, needs to be implemented.

### Message 5: Clear Next Steps
**All documents agree**: Add SSE event type, create channel, modify `narrate()`.

## ⚠️ No Contradictions Found

### Checked For:
- ✅ Event counts (all say 13 + 8 = 21)
- ✅ Architecture description (all say dual output)
- ✅ Implementation status (all say stdout done, SSE pending)
- ✅ Next steps (all agree on implementation plan)
- ✅ User experience (all show same examples)

### Result: **FULLY ALIGNED** ✅
