## What We Built

### Core Implementation

**File:** `src/backend/candle_backend.rs` (~340 lines)

```rust
pub struct CandleInferenceBackend {
    model: Llama,              // candle-transformers Llama
    tokenizer: Tokenizer,      // HuggingFace tokenizers
    device: Device,            // CPU/CUDA/Accelerate
    config: Config,            // Model config
    model_size_bytes: u64,     // Memory tracking
}
```

**Key methods:**
- `load(model_path, device)` - Load SafeTensors model + tokenizer
- `execute(prompt, config)` - Generate tokens with streaming
- `sample_token(logits, config)` - Greedy/temperature sampling

### Binary Entry Points

**Files:**
- `src/bin/cpu.rs` - CPU worker
- `src/bin/cuda.rs` - CUDA worker (with `--cuda-device` flag)
- `src/bin/accelerate.rs` - Accelerate worker

All follow same pattern:
1. Initialize device
2. Load model + tokenizer
3. Callback to pool-managerd
4. Start HTTP server

### Feature Gates

**Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[features]
cpu = []
cuda = ["candle-kernels", "cudarc", "candle-core/cuda", "candle-nn/cuda"]
accelerate = ["candle-core/accelerate", "candle-nn/accelerate"]

[[bin]]
name = "llorch-cpu-candled"
path = "src/bin/cpu.rs"
required-features = ["cpu"]
# ... (cuda, accelerate)
```

---

## How to Use

### Build

```bash
# CPU
cargo build --release --features cpu --bin llorch-cpu-candled

# CUDA
cargo build --release --features cuda --bin llorch-cuda-candled

# Accelerate
cargo build --release --features accelerate --bin llorch-accelerate-candled
```

### Run

**Requirements:**
- SafeTensors format model directory
- `tokenizer.json` in model directory
- `config.json` in model directory

```bash
# CPU
./target/release/llorch-cpu-candled \
  --worker-id test-worker \
  --model /path/to/llama-2-7b/ \
  --port 8080 \
  --callback-url http://localhost:9999

# CUDA
./target/release/llorch-cuda-candled \
  --worker-id test-worker \
  --model /path/to/llama-2-7b/ \
  --port 8080 \
  --cuda-device 0 \
  --callback-url http://localhost:9999
```

### Test

```bash
# Smoke tests
cargo test --test team_009_smoke --features cpu

# All tests
cargo test --features cpu
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Use candle-transformers Llama Directly

**Decision:** Use `candle-transformers::models::llama::Llama` instead of building layers from scratch.

**Rationale:**
- TEAM-008 discovered Candle has complete Llama implementation
- 4-6 hours to working inference vs 20-30 hours for custom layers
- Production-ready, optimized by Candle team
- Focus on worker integration, not layer implementation

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Less educational value (black box)
- ❌ Harder to customize
- ✅ Much faster to ship
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Less maintenance burden

### 2. SafeTensors Only (GGUF Deferred)

**Decision:** Support SafeTensors format only, defer GGUF.

**Rationale:**
- GGUF support in candle-transformers requires different API
- `ModelWeights::from_gguf` needs `Content` parameter (complex)
- SafeTensors is sufficient for initial release
- Can add GGUF later if needed

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn load_gguf(_path: &str, _device: &Device) -> Result<(Llama, Config, u64)> {
    bail!("GGUF support not yet implemented - use SafeTensors format instead");
}
```

### 3. Device Residency Logging (Not Enforcement)

**Decision:** Log device residency, don't enforce with assertions.

**Rationale:**
- `Device` doesn't implement `PartialEq` in Candle
- Can't compare `input_ids.device() != &self.device`
- Logging is sufficient for debugging

**Implementation:**
```rust
if pos == 0 {
    tracing::debug!(
        input_device = ?input_ids.device(),
        expected_device = ?self.device,
        "Device residency check: input tensor"
    );
}
```

### 4. Default to 7B Config

**Decision:** Use `Config::config_7b_v2(false)` as default, ignore `config.json`.

**Rationale:**
- `Config` doesn't implement `Deserialize` in candle-transformers
- Would need manual parsing of JSON to construct Config
- 7B is most common model size
- Can add config parsing later

**TODO:** Parse `config.json` to determine actual model size.

---

## What Works

✅ **Device initialization:**
- CPU: `Device::Cpu`
- CUDA: `Device::new_cuda(idx)`
- Accelerate: `Device::Cpu` (with Accelerate framework)

✅ **Model loading:**
- SafeTensors files via `VarBuilder::from_mmaped_safetensors`
- Memory-mapped for efficiency
- Calculates total model size

✅ **Tokenization:**
- HuggingFace tokenizers (`tokenizer.json`)
- Encode prompt to token IDs
- Decode tokens to text (streaming)

✅ **Generation:**
- Autoregressive token generation
- KV cache management (via Candle's Cache)
- EOS token detection

✅ **Sampling:**
- Greedy (temperature=0)
- Temperature sampling
- Softmax + random sampling

✅ **Worker integration:**
- `InferenceBackend` trait fully implemented
- HTTP server via worker-http
- Pool manager callbacks

---

## What Doesn't Work

❌ **GGUF format:**
- Not implemented (use SafeTensors)
- Error message guides user to SafeTensors

❌ **Config parsing:**
- Always uses 7B config
- Ignores `config.json` contents
- TODO: Parse JSON to determine model size

❌ **Advanced sampling:**
- No top-k, top-p, repetition penalty
- Only greedy and temperature
- Can add later if needed

❌ **Streaming HTTP:**
- Returns complete result, not SSE stream
- worker-http may support streaming, not wired up yet

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Unused Imports/Variables

Several unused imports in old layer code:
- `src/cache/kv_cache.rs` - unused `Cache` import
- `src/layers/rms_norm.rs` - unused `DType` import
- `src/layers/attention.rs` - unused `Cache` import
- `src/device.rs` - unused `sum` variable

**Fix:** Run `cargo fix --lib -p rbees-workerd` or manually remove.

### 2. Old Layer Code Still Present

TEAM-000's layer implementations still exist:
- `src/layers/rms_norm.rs`
- `src/layers/rope.rs`
- `src/layers/attention.rs`
- `src/layers/swiglu.rs`

**Status:** Not used by TEAM-009 implementation. Can be deleted or kept as reference.

### 3. Integration Tests Broken

Old integration tests expect custom layer API:
- `tests/checkpoint_*.rs` - use old Cache API
- `tests/unified_cache_integration.rs` - references deleted code

**Fix:** Delete or rewrite to test candle-transformers integration.

---

## Performance Notes

### Build Time
- CPU binary: ~38 seconds (release)
- Binary size: ~15 MB (stripped)

### Runtime (Estimated)
- **CPU:** ~10-20 tokens/sec (Llama-2 7B, depends on CPU)
- **CUDA:** ~50-100 tokens/sec (depends on GPU)
- **Memory:** ~7GB for 7B model (F32), ~3.5GB (F16)

**Note:** Actual performance not benchmarked yet. Requires real model file.

---

## Testing Status

### Smoke Tests (TEAM-009)

**File:** `tests/team_009_smoke.rs`

✅ `test_cpu_device_init` - CPU device initialization
✅ `test_backend_requires_model_file` - Error handling
✅ `test_backend_rejects_gguf` - GGUF rejection
⏸️ `test_device_residency_enforcement` - Requires model (ignored)

**CUDA/Accelerate tests:** Conditional on features, not run in CI.

### Old Tests (TEAM-000)

**Status:** Most broken after TEAM-009 rewrite.

**Files:**
- `tests/checkpoint_*.rs` - Use old layer API
- `tests/unified_cache_integration.rs` - References deleted code
- `tests/multi_backend.rs` - May still work
- `tests/team_002_*.rs` - May still work

**Recommendation:** Delete broken tests or rewrite for candle-transformers.

## Next Steps (Future Teams)

### Priority 1: Make it Run

1. **Get a test model:**
   - Download Llama-2 7B in SafeTensors format
   - Place `tokenizer.json` and `config.json` in same directory
   - Run integration test with real model

2. **Fix config parsing:**
   - Parse `config.json` to determine model size
   - Support 7B, 13B, 70B configs
   - Use appropriate `Config::config_*` method

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Read the Library Docs First

TEAM-008 spent hours implementing unified cache, only to discover Candle already has one. **Lesson:** Check what the library provides before building.

### 2. Use High-Level APIs When Available

We pivoted from building layers to using `candle-transformers::Llama`. **Lesson:** Don't reinvent the wheel. Use mature implementations.

### 3. Feature Gates Are Powerful

Three binaries from one crate with zero runtime overhead. **Lesson:** Feature gates enable clean multi-backend support.

### 4. Defer Non-Critical Features

GGUF support deferred, config parsing deferred. **Lesson:** Ship minimal working version first, iterate later.

### 5. Device Residency is Hard to Enforce

Can't compare `Device` types directly. **Lesson:** Logging is sufficient for debugging, don't over-engineer.

## CRITICAL: Instructions for TEAM-010

### Your Mission: Challenge Everything

**TEAM-009 shipped fast. TEAM-010 must validate thoroughly.**

#### 1. Attack All Assumptions

**Do NOT trust TEAM-009's implementation blindly.** Your job is to:

- ✅ **Test every claim** - Does it actually work with real models?
- ✅ **Find hidden assumptions** - What did we assume but not verify?
- ✅ **Break the implementation** - Try edge cases, invalid inputs, large models
- ✅ **Verify device residency** - Are tensors actually staying on the right device?
- ✅ **Check memory usage** - Does it leak? Does it match claims?
- ✅ **Validate sampling** - Is temperature sampling actually correct?
- ✅ **Test tokenization** - Does detokenization work for all tokens?

**Why this matters:** TEAM-009 built without real model testing. Everything is theoretical until proven.

#### 2. Assumptions to Challenge

**TEAM-009 made these assumptions (UNVERIFIED):**

1. **SafeTensors loading works** - Never tested with real model
2. **Tokenizer integration works** - Never tested with real tokenizer.json
3. **Generation loop works** - Never generated actual text
4. **Device residency is correct** - Only logged, never enforced
5. **Sampling is correct** - Mathematical correctness unverified
6. **Config defaults to 7B works** - Never tested with actual 7B model
7. **Memory tracking is accurate** - Just file sizes, not actual usage
8. **EOS detection works** - Never tested with real EOS token

**Your job:** Test each assumption. Document failures. Fix or escalate.

#### 3. Required Testing

**Before TEAM-010 signs off, you MUST:**

- [ ] Download Llama-2 7B in SafeTensors format
- [ ] Test model loading end-to-end
- [ ] Generate at least 100 tokens successfully
- [ ] Verify output quality (not gibberish)
- [ ] Test temperature=0 (greedy) produces deterministic output
- [ ] Test temperature>0 produces varied output
- [ ] Test EOS detection stops generation
- [ ] Test max_tokens limit works
- [ ] Measure actual tokens/sec on CPU
- [ ] Profile memory usage during generation
- [ ] Test with prompts of varying lengths (1 token, 100 tokens, 1000 tokens)
- [ ] Test error handling (missing tokenizer, corrupt model, etc.)

**If ANY test fails:** Document it, fix it, or mark as known issue.

#### 4. Thorough Cleanup Required

**TEAM-009 left technical debt. TEAM-010 must clean it up.**

##### Files to Delete (Unused, Half-Baked)

**Old layer implementations (NOT used by TEAM-009):**
```

```

**Reason:** All test old layer implementations that are no longer used.

##### Crates to Mark as Deprecated

**In `Cargo.toml` dependencies:**

```toml
# DEPRECATED by TEAM-009: Using HuggingFace tokenizers instead
# Reason: Half-baked, incomplete, not production-ready
# worker-tokenizer = { path = "../worker-crates/worker-tokenizer" }

# DEPRECATED by TEAM-009: Using candle-transformers model adapters
# Reason: Half-baked, incomplete, not production-ready
# worker-models = { path = "../worker-crates/worker-models" }

# DEPRECATED by TEAM-009: Using VarBuilder for SafeTensors
# Reason: Half-baked, incomplete, not production-ready
# worker-gguf = { path = "../worker-crates/worker-gguf" }
```

**Action:** Comment out unused dependencies, add deprecation notes.

##### Cleanup Checklist

- [ ] Delete all files in `src/layers/` except `mod.rs`
- [ ] Delete `src/cache/kv_cache.rs`
- [ ] Delete `src/model/llama2.rs`
- [ ] Delete all `tests/checkpoint_*.rs` files
- [ ] Delete `tests/unified_cache_integration.rs`
- [ ] Delete `tests/team_002_*.rs` files
- [ ] Delete `tests/multi_backend.rs`
- [ ] Comment out unused worker-crates dependencies
- [ ] Run `cargo fix --lib -p rbees-workerd` to fix warnings
- [ ] Remove unused imports from remaining files
- [ ] Update `src/lib.rs` to remove references to deleted modules
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass after cleanup

#### 5. Code Review Checklist

**Review TEAM-009's implementation critically:**

##### Backend Implementation (`src/backend/candle_backend.rs`)

- [ ] Is error handling robust? (What happens on OOM, corrupt model, etc.)
- [ ] Is device residency actually enforced? (Logging is not enforcement)
- [ ] Is sampling mathematically correct? (Verify softmax, temperature, random sampling)
- [ ] Is tokenization correct? (Test with special tokens, unicode, etc.)
- [ ] Is EOS detection correct? (What if model doesn't have </s>?)
- [ ] Is memory tracking accurate? (File size ≠ actual memory usage)
- [ ] Are there race conditions? (Single-threaded, but still check)
- [ ] Is the generation loop correct? (KV cache position tracking, etc.)

##### Binary Entry Points (`src/bin/*.rs`)

- [ ] Do all three binaries actually work? (CPU tested, CUDA/Accelerate not)
- [ ] Is device initialization correct for each backend?
- [ ] Is error handling consistent across binaries?
- [ ] Are CLI arguments validated?

##### Tests (`tests/team_009_smoke.rs`)

- [ ] Are smoke tests sufficient? (They only test device init, not inference)
- [ ] Is the ignored integration test actually useful?
- [ ] What's missing? (No sampling tests, no tokenization tests, no generation tests)

#### 6. What "Right Thing" Means

**The right thing is NOT:**
- ❌ Assuming TEAM-009 got it right
- ❌ Trusting code that was never tested with real models
- ❌ Leaving half-baked code in the codebase
- ❌ Shipping without validation

**The right thing IS:**
- ✅ Testing every assumption with real data
- ✅ Deleting code that doesn't serve a purpose
- ✅ Documenting what actually works vs what's theoretical
- ✅ Being honest about limitations and unknowns
- ✅ Cleaning up technical debt before it compounds

#### 7. Success Criteria for TEAM-010

**You are DONE when:**

1. ✅ You've tested with a real Llama model and generated actual text
2. ✅ You've challenged every assumption and documented results
3. ✅ You've deleted all deprecated code and tests
4. ✅ You've fixed all warnings and unused imports
5. ✅ You've documented actual performance (not estimates)
6. ✅ You've documented known issues and limitations
7. ✅ You've updated README with real usage examples (not theoretical)
8. ✅ You can confidently say "This works" based on evidence, not hope

#### 8. If You Find Major Issues

**If TEAM-009's implementation is fundamentally broken:**

1. Document the issue clearly
2. Assess impact (blocking vs non-blocking)
3. Fix if possible, escalate if not
4. Update handoff with findings
5. Do NOT hide problems to "ship fast"

**Remember:** It's better to ship late and correct than fast and broken.
