# error-recovery

**Automated error recovery and self-healing**

Implements recovery strategies for common failure modes: worker crashes, model load failures, VRAM exhaustion, etc.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Retry logic (with exponential backoff)
- Fallback strategies (use cached model if fresh load fails)
- Graceful degradation (reduce replica count if VRAM constrained)
- Recovery playbooks per error type
- Dead letter queue for unrecoverable errors
