# TEAM-218 COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Date:** Oct 22, 2025  
**Team:** TEAM-218  
**Component:** rbee-hive (bin/20_rbee_hive)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Mission Accomplished

Completed comprehensive behavior investigation of rbee-hive daemon to enable test coverage planning.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Behavior Inventory Document ✅
**File:** `bin/.plan/TEAM_218_RBEE_HIVE_BEHAVIORS.md`  
**Length:** 461 lines (within 3-page limit)  
**Sections:** 10/10 complete

### 2. Code Signatures Added ✅
All investigated files marked with `// TEAM-218: Investigated Oct 22, 2025`:
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs` (line 5)
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/lib.rs` (line 2)
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/narration.rs` (line 4)
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/heartbeat.rs` (line 4)

### 3. Compilation Verified ✅
```bash
cargo check -p rbee-hive
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS (warnings only, no errors)

---

## Key Findings

### Implementation Status

**Currently Implemented (2 endpoints):**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /capabilities` - Device detection with GPU/CPU info

**Documented but NOT Implemented (9 endpoints):**
- Worker management endpoints (spawn, list, ready callback)
- Model management endpoints (download, progress)
- Heartbeat receiver endpoint
- VRAM capacity check endpoint
- Graceful shutdown endpoint

**Critical Discovery:** Major discrepancy between documentation (IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) and actual code (main.rs). Only 2 of 11 documented endpoints exist.

### Supporting Crates Status

**Active:**
- `device-detection` - ✅ Used in main.rs for GPU/CPU detection

**Stubs (NOT Implemented):**
- `worker-lifecycle` - ❌ STUB
- `worker-registry` - ❌ STUB
- `model-catalog` - ❌ STUB
- `model-provisioner` - ❌ STUB
- `download-tracker` - ❌ STUB
- `monitor` - ❌ STUB
- `vram-checker` - ❌ STUB (has Cargo.toml but no implementation)
- `worker-catalog` - ❌ STUB

### Test Coverage

**Unit Tests:** 0  
**BDD Scenarios:** 19 defined, 0 implemented  
**Integration Tests:** 0  
**Total Test Coverage:** 0%

## Critical Gaps Identified

### Functionality Gaps (Blocks Production)
1. Worker management NOT implemented
2. Model management NOT implemented
3. Graceful shutdown NOT implemented
4. VRAM capacity checking NOT implemented
5. Heartbeat relay NOT implemented

### Test Coverage Gaps
1. NO unit tests
2. BDD step definitions missing (19 scenarios defined)
3. NO integration tests
4. NO end-to-end tests

### Documentation Gaps
1. Discrepancy between docs and code (11 documented endpoints, 2 implemented)
2. No OpenAPI/Swagger spec
3. No error response documentation

---

## Behavior Summary

### What Works
- ✅ Daemon startup with CLI args (port, hive_id, queen_url)
- ✅ HTTP server on localhost:9000 (configurable port)
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Device detection (GPU via nvidia-smi, CPU via system calls)
- ✅ Heartbeat task (sends to queen every 5s)
- ✅ Narration system (9 narration events)

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Worker spawning/stopping/listing
- ❌ Model downloading/provisioning
- ❌ Worker heartbeat receiving
- ❌ VRAM capacity checking
- ❌ Graceful shutdown
- ❌ Worker registry tracking
- ❌ Model catalog management

## Architecture Insights

### Current Architecture
```
rbee-hive (main.rs)
├── HTTP Server (axum)
│   ├── GET /health
│   └── GET /capabilities
├── Heartbeat Task (background)
│   └── Sends to queen every 5s
└── Device Detection
    ├── GPU detection (nvidia-smi)
    └── CPU detection (system calls)
```

### Intended Architecture (from docs)
```
rbee-hive (documented)
├── HTTP Server (11 endpoints)
│   ├── Public: /health, /capabilities
│   └── Protected: 9 worker/model/management endpoints
├── Worker Management
│   ├── Spawn/stop workers
│   ├── Track worker state
│   └── Relay heartbeats
├── Model Management
│   ├── Download models
│   ├── Track downloads
│   └── Manage catalog
└── Device Management
    ├── GPU detection
    ├── VRAM checking
    └── Capacity validation
```

**Gap:** Only ~20% of intended functionality is implemented.

## Recommendations for Next Teams

### For TEAM-242 (Test Planning)
1. **Focus on existing functionality first:**
   - Daemon lifecycle tests
   - Device detection tests
   - Heartbeat tests
   - Narration tests

2. **Plan for future functionality:**
   - Worker management tests (when implemented)
   - Model management tests (when implemented)
   - Integration tests (when components exist)

3. **Prioritize:**
   - P0: Test what exists (2 endpoints, heartbeat, device detection)
   - P1: Plan tests for documented endpoints (when implemented)
   - P2: Integration tests (requires multiple components)

### For Implementation Teams
1. **Resolve documentation discrepancy:**
   - Update IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md to reflect reality
   - OR implement the 9 missing endpoints
   - Document which is the source of truth

2. **Implement supporting crates:**
   - worker-registry (critical for worker tracking)
   - worker-lifecycle (critical for worker management)
   - model-catalog (critical for model management)
   - vram-checker (critical for capacity validation)

3. **Add graceful shutdown:**
   - Signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - Worker cleanup on exit
   - Heartbeat task cleanup

## Handoff to TEAM-242

**Input for Test Planning:**
- Behavior inventory: `TEAM_218_RBEE_HIVE_BEHAVIORS.md`
- 461 lines of documented behaviors
- 2 implemented endpoints to test
- 9 documented endpoints to plan for
- 0 existing tests to build on

**Recommended Test Strategy:**
1. Start with daemon lifecycle tests (startup, CLI args)
2. Add device detection tests (GPU/CPU detection)
3. Add heartbeat tests (background task, queen communication)
4. Plan integration tests for future endpoints
5. Add BDD step definitions for 19 existing scenarios

**Blockers for Full Testing:**
- Worker management not implemented (cannot test)
- Model management not implemented (cannot test)
- Graceful shutdown not implemented (cannot test)
- Most supporting crates are stubs (limited integration testing)
