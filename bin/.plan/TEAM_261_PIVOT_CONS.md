# TEAM-261 Pivot Analysis: Hive as CLI (Not Daemon)

## CONS: Why Hive Should Stay a Daemon

**Date:** Oct 23, 2025  
**Proposal:** Convert rbee-hive from daemon to CLI tool  
**Status:** 🔴 ANALYSIS - CONS

---

## Executive Summary

**Proposal:** Make `rbee-hive` a CLI tool instead of a daemon.

**This document:** Arguments AGAINST the pivot (why daemon is better).

---

## 1. 🐌 SSH Overhead for Every Operation

### Performance Impact

**Current (Daemon):**
```
Queen → HTTP POST (local network, ~1-5ms)
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```
Queen → SSH connection setup (~50-200ms)
      → Authentication (~10-50ms)
      → Command execution (~10-50ms)
      → Output capture (~10-50ms)
Total: ~80-350ms per operation
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ 10-100x slower per operation
- ❌ SSH handshake for EVERY command
- ❌ Noticeable latency for users
- ❌ Worse user experience

### Batch Operations

**Scenario:** Spawn 10 workers for different models

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Parallel HTTP requests
for model in models {
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        client.submit_and_stream(WorkerSpawn { model, .. }).await
    });
}
// Total time: ~1-2 seconds (parallel)
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// Sequential SSH commands (can't parallelize easily)
for model in models {
    ssh_exec(&format!("rbee-hive worker spawn --model {}", model)).await?;
}
// Total time: ~8-35 seconds (sequential SSH overhead)
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Much slower for batch operations
- ❌ Hard to parallelize SSH commands
- ❌ Poor user experience for multi-worker setups

---

## 2. 🔄 No Real-Time Streaming

### SSE Streaming Lost

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Real-time progress updates via SSE
client.submit_and_stream(operation, |line| {
    println!("{}", line);  // Instant feedback
    Ok(())
}).await?;

// User sees:
// "🔍 Detecting GPUs..."
// "✅ Found 2 GPUs"
// "🔧 Spawning worker..."
// "✅ Worker started"
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// Wait for entire command to complete
let output = ssh_exec("rbee-hive worker spawn ...").await?;
println!("{}", output);  // All at once at the end

// User sees:
// ... (waiting 5-10 seconds) ...
// "Worker started"  (no progress updates)
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ No real-time progress updates
- ❌ User doesn't know what's happening
- ❌ Worse UX for long operations (model download, GPU detection)
- ❌ Can't show incremental progress

### No Streaming for Model Downloads

**Current (Daemon):**
```
POST /v1/jobs → Create job
GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream → SSE stream
  data: Downloading model... 10%
  data: Downloading model... 50%
  data: Downloading model... 100%
  data: [DONE]
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```
ssh_exec("rbee-hive model download ...") → Wait...
(No progress updates for 5 minutes)
→ "Model downloaded"
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ No progress bars
- ❌ User thinks it's frozen
- ❌ Can't cancel mid-download
- ❌ Poor UX

---

## 3. 🚫 SSH Dependency Becomes Critical

### Single Point of Failure

**Current:**
- SSH needed for: install, capabilities, remote start
- HTTP used for: worker operations
- If SSH fails, some operations still work

**Proposed:**
- SSH needed for: EVERYTHING
- If SSH fails, NOTHING works
- Single point of failure

**Impact:**
- ❌ SSH becomes critical dependency
- ❌ SSH issues block all operations
- ❌ No fallback mechanism
- ❌ Higher risk of total failure

### SSH Configuration Complexity

**Current:**
- SSH only for admin operations
- Worker operations use HTTP (simpler)

**Proposed:**
- SSH for ALL operations
- Must handle:
  - SSH key management
  - SSH agent forwarding
  - SSH connection pooling
  - SSH timeout handling
  - SSH error recovery

**Impact:**
- ❌ More SSH complexity
- ❌ More failure modes
- ❌ Harder to debug
- ❌ More user configuration needed

---

## 4. 📊 No State Caching

### Repeated Queries

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Hive caches worker registry in memory
GET /v1/workers → Instant response from cache
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// Must query disk/processes every time
rbee-hive worker list → Scan processes, read files, format output
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Slower list operations
- ❌ More disk I/O
- ❌ More CPU usage
- ❌ No caching benefits

### Capabilities Caching

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Hive caches GPU info after first detection
GET /capabilities → Return cached data (instant)
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// Must run nvidia-smi every time
rbee-hive capabilities → Run nvidia-smi (slow)
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Repeated GPU detection
- ❌ Slower capabilities queries
- ❌ More overhead

---

## 5. 🔐 Security Concerns

### Command Injection Risk

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Structured JSON payload
let operation = Operation::WorkerSpawn {
    hive_id: "localhost",
    model: "llama-2-7b",
    worker: "cpu",
    device: 0,
};
client.submit_and_stream(operation, ...).await?;
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// String interpolation (dangerous!)
let cmd = format!(
    "rbee-hive worker spawn --model {} --device {}",
    model,  // What if model = "test; rm -rf /"?
    device
);
ssh_exec(&cmd).await?;
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Command injection vulnerability
- ❌ Must sanitize all inputs
- ❌ Easy to get wrong
- ❌ Security risk

### Privilege Escalation

**Current (Daemon):**
- Hive daemon runs as specific user
- HTTP requests are authenticated
- Clear security boundary

**Proposed (CLI):**
- SSH user has direct shell access
- Can run ANY command
- Harder to restrict

**Impact:**
- ❌ Broader attack surface
- ❌ Harder to restrict permissions
- ❌ SSH user can do more than intended

---

## 6. 🎭 Inconsistent Architecture

### Mixed Patterns

**Current (Consistent):**
```
rbee-keeper (CLI) → queen-rbee (daemon)
queen-rbee (daemon) → rbee-hive (daemon)
rbee-hive (daemon) → llm-worker-rbee (daemon)

All daemons use HTTP + job-server pattern
```

**Proposed (Inconsistent):**
```
rbee-keeper (CLI) → queen-rbee (daemon)
queen-rbee (daemon) → rbee-hive (CLI) ← Different!
rbee-hive (CLI) → llm-worker-rbee (daemon)

Mixed patterns: HTTP + SSH + CLI
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Inconsistent architecture
- ❌ Two different patterns to maintain
- ❌ Harder to reason about
- ❌ More complexity

### Code Duplication

**Current:**
- `job-server` pattern used by queen + hive + worker
- Shared code, shared patterns
- Single source of truth

**Proposed:**
- Queen uses job-server
- Hive uses CLI
- Worker uses job-server
- Different patterns, different code

**Impact:**
- ❌ Code duplication
- ❌ Different error handling
- ❌ Different logging
- ❌ Harder to maintain

---

## 7. 🔧 Harder to Debug

### No Live Inspection

**Current (Daemon):**
```bash
# Check hive status
curl http://localhost:9000/health

# Check worker registry
curl http://localhost:9000/v1/workers

# Check capabilities
curl http://localhost:9000/capabilities
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```bash
# No way to inspect hive state
# Must run commands to query

# No health endpoint
# No live debugging
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Can't inspect live state
- ❌ No health checks
- ❌ Harder to debug issues
- ❌ Less observability

### No Metrics

**Current (Daemon):**
- Can add Prometheus metrics
- Can track request rates
- Can monitor performance

**Proposed (CLI):**
- No metrics (process exits)
- Can't track usage
- Can't monitor performance

**Impact:**
- ❌ No observability
- ❌ Can't track usage patterns
- ❌ Can't optimize performance

---

## 8. 🚀 Startup Cost for Every Operation

### Process Spawn Overhead

**Current (Daemon):**
```
Operation → Already running → Execute → Response
            (0ms startup)
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```
Operation → Spawn process → Load binary → Parse args → Execute → Exit
            (~50-100ms)
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ 50-100ms overhead per operation
- ❌ More CPU usage (process spawning)
- ❌ More memory churn
- ❌ Slower operations

### Binary Loading

**Current (Daemon):**
- Binary loaded once
- Stays in memory
- Instant execution

**Proposed (CLI):**
- Binary loaded every time
- Disk I/O every time
- Slower execution

**Impact:**
- ❌ More disk I/O
- ❌ Slower operations
- ❌ More wear on SSD

---

## 9. 📡 No Asynchronous Operations

### Background Tasks

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Can run background tasks
tokio::spawn(async {
    // Periodic cleanup
    // Periodic health checks
    // Periodic state sync
});
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// No background tasks
// Everything is synchronous
// Must wait for completion
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ No background cleanup
- ❌ No periodic tasks
- ❌ Everything is blocking
- ❌ Worse for long operations

### Worker Monitoring

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Hive can monitor workers in background
tokio::spawn(async {
    loop {
        check_worker_health().await;
        sleep(Duration::from_secs(30)).await;
    }
});
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// No monitoring
// Must rely on worker heartbeats only
// No local health checks
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ No local worker monitoring
- ❌ Slower failure detection
- ❌ More reliance on network

---

## 10. 🔄 Connection Pooling Lost

### HTTP Connection Reuse

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// HTTP client reuses connections
let client = JobClient::new(&hive_url);
for operation in operations {
    client.submit_and_stream(operation, ...).await?;
    // Reuses TCP connection
}
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// New SSH connection every time
for operation in operations {
    ssh_exec(&format!("rbee-hive ...")).await?;
    // New SSH handshake every time
}
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ No connection reuse
- ❌ More network overhead
- ❌ Slower batch operations
- ❌ More resource usage

---

## 11. 🎯 Worse for Local Development

### Localhost Optimization Lost

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Localhost hive uses HTTP (fast)
let client = JobClient::new("http://localhost:9000");
client.submit_and_stream(operation, ...).await?;
// ~1-5ms latency
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// Even localhost uses SSH
ssh_exec("localhost", "rbee-hive ...").await?;
// ~50-200ms latency (even on localhost!)
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Slower even on localhost
- ❌ SSH overhead for local operations
- ❌ Worse dev experience
- ❌ Slower testing

---

## 12. 📦 Integration Test Complexity

### Mock SSH Complexity

**Current (Integration Tests):**
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_worker_spawn() {
    // Start mock hive daemon
    let hive = start_mock_hive().await;
    
    // Test via HTTP
    let client = JobClient::new(&hive.url());
    client.submit_and_stream(operation, ...).await?;
}
```

**Proposed (Integration Tests):**
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_worker_spawn() {
    // Must mock SSH server
    let ssh_server = start_mock_ssh_server().await;
    
    // Must handle SSH protocol
    // Must handle command parsing
    // Must handle output capture
    // Much more complex!
}
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ More complex test setup
- ❌ Must mock SSH server
- ❌ Harder to test error cases
- ❌ Slower tests

---

## 13. 🌐 Network Reliability

### HTTP is More Reliable

**Current (HTTP):**
- Stateless protocol
- Clear error codes
- Easy retry logic
- Well-understood failure modes

**Proposed (SSH):**
- Stateful protocol
- Connection can hang
- Harder retry logic
- More failure modes

**Impact:**
- ❌ More network issues
- ❌ Harder error handling
- ❌ More edge cases
- ❌ Less reliable

### Timeout Handling

**Current (HTTP):**
```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .build()?;
// Clear timeout behavior
```

**Proposed (SSH):**
```rust
// SSH timeout is complex
// Must handle:
// - Connection timeout
// - Command timeout
// - Output timeout
// - Disconnect timeout
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ More timeout complexity
- ❌ Harder to configure
- ❌ More edge cases

---

## 14. 🔧 Lost Work

### Code Already Written

**Current:**
- `job-server` pattern implemented
- HTTP handlers written
- Tests written
- Documentation written
- ~400 LOC invested

**Proposed:**
- Throw away all that work
- Rewrite as CLI
- Rewrite tests
- Rewrite documentation

**Impact:**
- ❌ Wasted effort
- ❌ Must rewrite everything
- ❌ Risk of new bugs
- ❌ Delay to production

---

## 15. 🎭 Worker Lifecycle Complexity

### Process Management

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Hive daemon can track spawned workers
struct WorkerRegistry {
    workers: HashMap<String, WorkerInfo>,
    pids: HashMap<String, u32>,
}

// Can kill workers reliably
kill_process(pid).await?;
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// CLI exits immediately after spawn
// Can't track worker PIDs
// Must query system to find workers
// Harder to kill workers
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Harder to track workers
- ❌ Harder to kill workers
- ❌ More process management complexity
- ❌ Less reliable cleanup

### Orphaned Processes

**Current (Daemon):**
- Hive daemon tracks all spawned workers
- Can clean up on shutdown
- No orphaned processes

**Proposed (CLI):**
- CLI exits immediately
- Workers become orphans
- Harder to track
- Harder to clean up

**Impact:**
- ❌ More orphaned processes
- ❌ Harder cleanup
- ❌ Resource leaks

---

## 16. 📊 No Request Queuing

### Concurrent Requests

**Current (Daemon):**
```rust
// Hive daemon can queue requests
// Can handle concurrent operations
// Can prioritize operations
```

**Proposed (CLI):**
```rust
// Each CLI invocation is independent
// No coordination between requests
// Race conditions possible
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ No request queuing
- ❌ Race conditions
- ❌ No prioritization
- ❌ Harder to manage concurrency

---

## 17. 🔐 SSH Key Management Burden

### Key Distribution

**Current:**
- SSH keys needed for admin operations
- Limited scope

**Proposed:**
- SSH keys needed for ALL operations
- Must be distributed to all queens
- Must be rotated regularly
- More key management

**Impact:**
- ❌ More key management
- ❌ More security overhead
- ❌ More operational burden
- ❌ More failure modes

---

## 18. 🎯 Doesn't Match Industry Patterns

### Industry Standard: Daemons

**Examples:**
- Kubernetes: kubelet (daemon)
- Docker: dockerd (daemon)
- Nomad: nomad agent (daemon)
- Consul: consul agent (daemon)

**All use daemons for node-level operations**

**Proposed:**
- Use CLI instead
- Goes against industry patterns
- Harder to explain
- Less familiar to operators

**Impact:**
- ❌ Non-standard approach
- ❌ Harder to explain
- ❌ Less familiar
- ❌ More questions from users
