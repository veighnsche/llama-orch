## Key Findings

### Current State

**Test Coverage:** ~10-20% (basic unit tests only)

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ Basic narration functionality
- ✅ Basic operation serialization
- ✅ Basic timeout enforcement
- ✅ Some E2E happy paths (manual testing)

**What's NOT Tested:**
- ❌ SSE channel lifecycle (memory leaks, race conditions)
- ❌ Concurrent access patterns (job registry, config files)
- ❌ Error propagation (all boundaries)
- ❌ Timeout scenarios (all layers)
- ❌ Resource cleanup (disconnect, crash, timeout)
- ❌ Integration flows (most scenarios)
- ❌ Edge cases (network failures, crashes, partitions)

---

## Critical Gaps (Must Fix First)

### 1. SSE Channel Lifecycle
**Impact:** HIGH - Memory leaks, data corruption  
**Components:** narration-core, job-registry, queen-rbee  
**Tests Needed:** 15-20 tests  
**Effort:** 5-7 days

**Issues:**
- Memory leaks if channels not cleaned up
- Race conditions (narration before channel created)
- Concurrent access to channel HashMap
- No tests for channel isolation

### 2. Concurrent Access Patterns
**Impact:** HIGH - Race conditions, data corruption  
**Components:** job-registry, rbee-config, all registries  
**Tests Needed:** 20-30 tests  
**Effort:** 7-10 days

**Issues:**
- Concurrent job creation/removal
- Concurrent config file access
- Concurrent registry updates
- No locking tests

### 3. Timeout Propagation
**Impact:** HIGH - Orphaned operations, resource leaks  
**Components:** All (keeper, queen, hive, worker)  
**Tests Needed:** 15-20 tests  
**Effort:** 5-7 days

**Issues:**
- Only keeper has timeout (30s)
- Queen/Hive/Worker have no timeouts
- Operations continue after client disconnect
- No cleanup signal propagates

### 4. Resource Cleanup
**Impact:** HIGH - Memory leaks, zombie processes  
**Components:** All binaries  
**Tests Needed:** 20-25 tests  
**Effort:** 7-10 days

**Issues:**
- No cleanup on client disconnect
- No cleanup on timeout
- No cleanup on crash
- Jobs/channels accumulate in memory

### 5. Error Propagation
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Poor user experience  
**Components:** All integration boundaries  
**Tests Needed:** 25-30 tests  
**Effort:** 7-10 days

**Issues:**
- Some errors not propagated to client
- Error messages unclear
- No error narration in some paths
- Timeouts not visible to user

### 6. Stdio::null() Behavior
**Impact:** HIGH - E2E tests hang  
**Components:** daemon-lifecycle  
**Tests Needed:** 5-10 tests  
**Effort:** 2-3 days

**Issues:**
- Critical for E2E tests (prevents pipe hangs)
- No tests verify Stdio::null() works
- No tests for Command::output() scenario

### 7. job_id Propagation
**Impact:** HIGH - Narration doesn't reach SSE  
**Components:** All server-side components  
**Tests Needed:** 10-15 tests  
**Effort:** 3-5 days

**Issues:**
- Without job_id, events are dropped
- No tests verify job_id propagation
- No tests verify SSE routing
- TimeoutEnforcer job_id recently added (needs tests)
