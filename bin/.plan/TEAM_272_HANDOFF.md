# TEAM-272 HANDOFF: Worker Lifecycle Management

**Date:** Oct 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Effort:** ~3 hours

---

## 🎯 Mission Complete

Implemented worker management operations following the **CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE** from `CORRECTION_269_TO_272_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md`.

**Key Architectural Decision:** Hive is STATELESS - workers are tracked by queen via heartbeats.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Worker Deletion Module (✅ COMPLETE)

**File:** `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/delete.rs` (151 LOC)

**Function:** `delete_worker(job_id, worker_id, pid)`

**Features:**
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM → wait 2s → SIGKILL)
- ✅ Platform-specific (Unix only, Windows not implemented)
- ✅ Full narration support with job_id routing
- ✅ Error handling (doesn't fail if process already dead)

**Example:**
```rust
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::delete_worker;

delete_worker(&job_id, "worker-123", 12345).await?;
```

### 2. Updated worker-lifecycle Crate (✅ COMPLETE)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib.rs` - Added delete module, architectural notes
- `Cargo.toml` - Added nix dependency for Unix process killing

**Architecture Notes Added:**
```rust
// NOTE: WorkerList and WorkerGet are NOT implemented in hive
// According to corrected architecture (CORRECTION_269_TO_272_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md):
// - Hive is STATELESS executor
// - Worker tracking happens in QUEEN via heartbeats
// - WorkerList/WorkerGet should query queen's registry, not hive
// - WorkerDelete is the only operation that makes sense in hive (kill process by PID)
```

### 3. Job Router Integration (✅ COMPLETE)

**File:** `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs`

**Operations Wired:**

#### WorkerSpawn (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```rust
Operation::WorkerSpawn { hive_id, model, worker, device } => {
    // Calls rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::spawn_worker()
    // Allocates port, configures queen URL
    // Returns PID and port
}
```

#### WorkerList (⚠️ REDIRECTS TO QUEEN)
```rust
Operation::WorkerList { hive_id } => {
    // Emits narration explaining hive is stateless
    // Returns empty list
    // TODO: Should be handled by queen-rbee
}
```

#### WorkerGet (⚠️ REDIRECTS TO QUEEN)
```rust
Operation::WorkerGet { hive_id, id } => {
    // Emits narration explaining hive is stateless
    // Returns error directing to query queen
    // TODO: Should be handled by queen-rbee
}
```

#### WorkerDelete (⚠️ NEEDS PID FROM QUEEN)
```rust
Operation::WorkerDelete { hive_id, id } => {
    // Emits narration explaining architecture
    // Returns error: needs PID from queen
    // TODO: Once queen provides PID, call delete_worker()
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Alignment

### Corrected Architecture (CORRECTION_269_TO_272)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ QUEEN (Orchestrator)                                        │

│ - Routes inference requests to workers                      │
│ - Worker registry (who's alive, what they serve)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │

│ HIVE (Executor)                                             │

│ - Executes WorkerDelete operation (with PID from queen)     │
│ - NO worker tracking (stateless)                            │
│ - NO WorkerList/WorkerGet (query queen instead)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ WORKER (Inference Engine)                                   │
│ - Sends heartbeat to QUEEN (not hive!)                      │
│ - Serves inference requests                                 │
│ - Implements worker contract                                │

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests

**File:** `worker-lifecycle/src/delete.rs`

```rust
#[tokio::test]
#[cfg(unix)]
async fn test_kill_nonexistent_process() {
    // Trying to kill a non-existent process should not fail
    let result = kill_process("test-job", 999999).await;
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
```

**Run:**
```bash
cargo test --package rbee-hive-worker-lifecycle

cargo check --bin rbee-hive
# ✅ PASS (with warnings about unused code - expected)
```

## 📝 Narration Events

### Worker Deletion

```
[worker-lc] worker_delete_start: 🗑️  Deleting worker 'worker-123' (PID: 12345)
[worker-lc] worker_delete_sigterm: Sending SIGTERM to PID 12345
[worker-lc] worker_delete_sigterm_sent: SIGTERM sent successfully
[worker-lc] worker_delete_graceful: Process terminated gracefully
[worker-lc] worker_delete_complete: ✅ Worker 'worker-123' deleted
```

### Worker Spawn (TEAM-271)

```
[worker-lc] worker_spawn_start: 🚀 Spawning worker 'worker-123' for model 'meta-llama/Llama-3-8b' on device 'cuda:0' port 9001
[worker-lc] worker_type_determined: Worker type: CudaLlm (device: cuda:0)
[worker-lc] worker_binary_found: Worker binary: /path/to/cuda-llm-worker-rbee
[worker-lc] worker_spawn_command: Command: /path/to/cuda-llm-worker-rbee --worker-id worker-123 ...
[worker-lc] worker_spawned: ✅ Worker 'worker-123' spawned (PID: 12345, port: 9001)
```

### Worker List (Redirect)

```
[hv-router] worker_list_redirect: ⚠️  WorkerList should query queen's registry, not hive
[hv-router] worker_list_architecture: Hive is STATELESS - workers send heartbeats to queen
[hv-router] worker_list_empty: No workers tracked in hive (query queen instead)
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. WorkerList/WorkerGet Not Implemented in Hive

**Reason:** Hive is stateless - workers are tracked by queen via heartbeats.

**Current Behavior:**
- WorkerList: Returns empty list with warning
- WorkerGet: Returns error directing to query queen

**Future:** These operations should be implemented in queen-rbee, not rbee-hive.

### 2. WorkerDelete Needs PID from Queen

**Reason:** Hive doesn't track workers, so it doesn't know PIDs.

**Current Behavior:** Returns error explaining architecture.

**Future:** Queen should provide PID when calling WorkerDelete:
```rust
// In queen-rbee:
let worker = worker_registry.get(&id)?;
let operation = Operation::WorkerDelete { 
    hive_id, 
    id, 
    pid: worker.pid  // ← Queen provides PID
};
forward_to_hive(operation).await?;
```

### 3. Port Allocation is Random

**Current:** Uses `rand::random()` for port allocation.

**Future:** Implement proper port allocation strategy:
- Track used ports
- Allocate sequentially from pool
- Handle port conflicts

### 4. Queen URL is Hardcoded

**Current:** `http://localhost:8500` hardcoded in job_router.rs

**Future:** Get from config or environment variable.

### 5. Platform Support

**Unix:** ✅ Full support (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)  
**Windows:** ❌ Not implemented

---

## 🔗 Next Steps for TEAM-273

### Job Router Integration

TEAM-273 should verify:
- ✅ WorkerSpawn is fully implemented
- ⚠️ WorkerList/WorkerGet redirect to queen (expected)
- ⚠️ WorkerDelete needs PID from queen (expected)

### Queen-rbee Integration

Future teams should implement in queen-rbee:
1. **Worker Registry** - Track workers via heartbeats
2. **WorkerList Handler** - Query registry, return workers
3. **WorkerGet Handler** - Query registry, return worker details
4. **WorkerDelete Enhancement** - Get PID from registry, forward to hive with PID

### Port Allocation

Implement proper port allocation:
```rust
pub struct PortAllocator {
    used_ports: Arc<Mutex<HashSet<u16>>>,
    next_port: Arc<Mutex<u16>>,
}

impl PortAllocator {
    pub fn allocate(&self) -> Result<u16> {
        // Allocate from pool, track usage
    }
    
    pub fn release(&self, port: u16) {
        // Release port back to pool
    }
}
```

## 📚 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Hive is Stateless

**Decision:** Hive does NOT track workers.

**Rationale:** 
- Queen is source of truth (receives heartbeats)
- Hive is just an executor
- Simpler, more scalable

**Impact:** WorkerList/WorkerGet must query queen, not hive.

### 2. WorkerDelete Requires PID

**Decision:** Hive needs PID to kill process.

**Rationale:**
- Hive doesn't track workers
- Queen has PID from heartbeats
- Queen must provide PID when calling WorkerDelete

**Impact:** WorkerDelete operation needs to be enhanced to include PID.

### 3. Graceful Shutdown

**Decision:** SIGTERM → wait 2s → SIGKILL

**Rationale:**
- Give worker chance to clean up
- Force kill if needed
- Standard Unix pattern

**Impact:** Workers should handle SIGTERM gracefully.
