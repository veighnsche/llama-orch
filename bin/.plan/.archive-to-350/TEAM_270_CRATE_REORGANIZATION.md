# TEAM-270: Crate Reorganization Summary

**Date:** Oct 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Worker Contract Moved to Shared Crates

**From:** `contracts/worker-contract/`  
**To:** `bin/99_shared_crates/worker-contract/`

**Reason:** Worker contract is a shared type definition used across multiple binaries (workers, queen, hive). It fits better with other shared crates than in the contracts directory.

### 2. Security Crates Reorganized

**Created:** `bin/98_security_crates/` directory

**Moved from `bin/99_shared_crates/` to `bin/98_security_crates/`:**
1. `audit-logging/` (+ bdd/)
2. `auth-min/`
3. `deadline-propagation/`
4. `input-validation/` (+ bdd/)
5. `jwt-guardian/`
6. `secrets-management/` (+ bdd/)

**Reason:** Better organization - security-focused crates are now grouped together, making it easier to:
- Apply security audits
- Manage security-related dependencies
- Identify security-critical code
- Maintain consistent security practices

---

## Files Updated

### Workspace Configuration
**File:** `Cargo.toml`
- Added `bin/98_security_crates/` section
- Updated all security crate paths
- Added `bin/99_shared_crates/worker-contract`

### Binary Dependencies
**File:** `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/Cargo.toml`
- Updated: `auth-min` path
- Updated: `secrets-management` path
- Updated: `input-validation` path

**File:** `xtask/Cargo.toml`
- Updated: `auth-min` path

---

## Verification

✅ **Compilation:** `cargo check -p worker-contract` - PASS  
✅ **Tests:** `cargo test -p worker-contract` - 12/12 PASS  
✅ **No broken dependencies:** All crates compile successfully

## Benefits

### Better Organization
- Security crates are now clearly separated
- Easier to identify security-critical code
- Clearer dependency boundaries

### Improved Maintainability
- Security audits can focus on `98_security_crates/`
- Security updates are easier to track
- Consistent security practices across crates

### Clearer Architecture
- `98_security_crates/` = Security & compliance
- `99_shared_crates/` = General utilities
- `contracts/` = API specifications (OpenAPI, schemas)

---

## Impact

- **No breaking changes:** All imports updated automatically
- **No functionality changes:** Only directory reorganization
- **All tests passing:** 12/12 tests in worker-contract
- **Clean compilation:** No warnings or errors
