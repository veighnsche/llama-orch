## üìä Complexity Breakdown

### Easy (20-24h)
- **TEAM-270:** Worker Registry
  - Similar to model-catalog
  - Standard CRUD patterns
  - Well-defined scope

### Medium (24-32h)
- **TEAM-269:** Model Provisioner
  - HTTP downloads
  - Progress tracking
  - File management
  
- **TEAM-272:** Worker Management
  - CRUD operations
  - Process cleanup
  - Platform differences

### Hard (32-40h) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **TEAM-271:** Worker Spawn
  - Process spawning
  - Port allocation
  - Binary resolution
  - Health checks
  - Many edge cases
  - **Requires careful testing!**

## üéì Key Patterns Used

### TEAM-269: Async Download Pattern
```rust
pub async fn download_model(&self, job_id: &str, model_id: &str) -> Result<String> {
    // Progress tracking with catalog updates
    self.catalog.update_status(model_id, ModelStatus::Downloading { progress: 0.5 })?;
}
```

### TEAM-270: Registry Pattern
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct WorkerRegistry {
    workers: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, WorkerEntry>>>,
}
```

### TEAM-271: Process Spawn Pattern
```rust
let mut child = Command::new(&self.worker_binary)
    .arg("--model").arg(model_id)
    .arg("--port").arg(port.to_string())
    .spawn()?;
```

### TEAM-272: Process Cleanup Pattern
```rust
#[cfg(unix)]
{
    kill(Pid::from_raw(pid as i32), Signal::SIGTERM)?;
}
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### All Teams
1. **Forgetting job_id** - All narration MUST include `.job_id()`
2. **Not following patterns** - Mirror TEAM-211/TEAM-268 CRUD style
3. **Skipping tests** - Unit tests are required
4. **Poor error messages** - Make errors descriptive

### TEAM-269 Specific
- Don't try to implement full HF Hub API (use placeholder)
- Progress tracking must update catalog status
- Handle duplicate downloads

### TEAM-270 Specific
- Use Arc<Mutex<>> not just Mutex
- Keep lock scope minimal
- Clone registry, not workers HashMap

### TEAM-271 Specific ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Worker binary may not exist (document this!)
- Port allocation can fail (handle gracefully)
- Process spawn can fail (clear error messages)
- Health check is TODO (use delay for v0.1.0)

### TEAM-272 Specific
- Process killing is platform-specific
- Use conditional compilation (#[cfg(unix)])
- SIGTERM before SIGKILL (graceful shutdown)
