**3. rbee-keeper (CLI: `rbee`)**
- SSH wrapper for remote pool control
- Remote model management
- Remote worker management
- Git operations (pull, status, build)

## Working Flow

```bash
# 1. Update remote pool
llorch pool git --host mac.home.arpa pull
llorch pool git --host mac.home.arpa build

# 2. Register models
llorch pool models --host mac.home.arpa register qwen-0.5b \
    --name "Qwen2.5 0.5B Instruct" \
    --repo "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct" \
    --architecture qwen

# 3. View catalog
llorch pool models --host mac.home.arpa catalog

# 4. Download models (CP4)
llorch pool models --host mac.home.arpa download qwen-0.5b

# 5. Spawn workers (CP4)
llorch pool worker --host mac.home.arpa spawn metal --model qwen-0.5b

# 6. List workers
llorch pool worker --host mac.home.arpa list

# 7. Stop workers
llorch pool worker --host mac.home.arpa stop worker-metal-0
```

## External Crates Analysis

### What We Built vs. What Exists

#### 1. **SSH Client** (Current: `std::process::Command`)
**Could Use:**
- `ssh2` - Native SSH library (we have it in workspace already!)
- `russh` - Pure Rust async SSH

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Our approach: Simple, relies on system SSH (keys already configured)
- ❌ ssh2: More control, but requires managing connections/auth
- **Verdict:** Current approach is simpler for our use case

#### 2. **Process Management** (Current: `std::process::Command` + `nix`)
**Could Use:**
- `daemonize` - Proper daemon creation
- `sysinfo` - Cross-platform process info
- `procfs` - Linux process filesystem

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Our approach: Direct control, Unix-specific
- ❌ daemonize: Better daemon handling, but overkill for background processes
- **Verdict:** Could improve with `daemonize` for production

#### 3. **CLI Framework** (Current: `clap`)
**Alternatives:**
- `structopt` (deprecated, merged into clap)
- `argh` - Lighter weight
- `pico-args` - Minimal

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ clap: Industry standard, derive macros, great UX
- **Verdict:** Perfect choice, no change needed

#### 4. **Colored Output** (Current: `colored`)
**Alternatives:**
- `owo-colors` - Faster, more features
- `termcolor` - Cross-platform
- `yansi` - Conditional coloring

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ colored: Simple API, works well
- ❌ owo-colors: Faster but more complex
- **Verdict:** Current is fine

#### 5. **JSON Handling** (Current: `serde_json`)
**Alternatives:**
- `simd-json` - Faster parsing
- `json` - Simpler API

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ serde_json: Standard, integrates with serde ecosystem
- **Verdict:** Perfect choice

#### 6. **File Downloads** (Current: `hf` CLI subprocess)
**Could Use:**
- `reqwest` - HTTP client (already in workspace!)
- `hf-hub` - Hugging Face Rust SDK (v0.4.3 available, used in candle/mistral.rs references)
- `tokio` + `reqwest` - Async downloads with progress

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Our approach: Delegates to official CLI, handles auth
- ❌ reqwest: More control, but need to handle HF auth/tokens
- **Verdict:** Could improve with `hf-hub` crate if it exists

#### 7. **Worker Info Storage** (Current: JSON files)
**Could Use:**
- `sled` - Embedded database
- `redb` - Pure Rust embedded DB
- `sqlite` - Via `rusqlite`

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Our approach: Simple, human-readable
- ❌ Database: Better for queries, but overkill for ~10 workers
- **Verdict:** Current is appropriate for scale

---

## Recommended Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Use `ssh2` crate** - Already in workspace, better error handling
2. **Use `daemonize` crate** - Proper daemon creation for workers
3. **Use `hf-hub` crate** - Native Rust HF downloads (if available)

### Medium Priority
4. **Use `sysinfo` crate** - Cross-platform process management
5. **Use `indicatif` crate** - Progress bars for downloads
6. **Use `tokio` + async** - Parallel operations

### Low Priority
7. **Use `owo-colors`** - Faster colored output
8. **Use `sled`** - If worker count grows >100

## Crate Dependency Audit

### Current Dependencies

**pool-core:**
```toml
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
```
✅ All standard, well-maintained

**rbee-hive:**
```toml
clap = { version = "4.5", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
colored = "2.0"
serde_json = "1.0"
hostname = "0.4"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
nix = { version = "0.27", features = ["signal", "process"] }
```
✅ All standard, could add:
- `indicatif = "0.17"` - Progress bars
- `hf-hub = "0.3"` - HF downloads (if exists)

**rbee-keeper:**
```toml
clap = { version = "4.5", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
colored = "2.0"
```
✅ Minimal, could add:
- `ssh2 = "0.9"` - Native SSH (already in workspace)

## What We Did Right

1. ✅ **Used workspace dependencies** - Consistent versions
2. ✅ **Minimal dependencies** - Only what's needed
3. ✅ **Standard crates** - Industry-proven (clap, serde, anyhow)
4. ✅ **Type safety** - Strong typing with enums
5. ✅ **Error handling** - Proper Result types
6. ✅ **Testing** - Unit tests in pool-core
7. ✅ **Documentation** - READMEs for all components

---

## What We Could Improve

### Code Quality
1. **Add more tests** - Integration tests for CLI commands
2. **Add progress bars** - Use `indicatif` for downloads
3. **Better error messages** - More context in errors
4. **Async operations** - Parallel downloads/spawns

### Architecture
5. **Use ssh2 crate** - Better SSH error handling
6. **Use daemonize** - Proper daemon creation
7. **Add retry logic** - For network operations
8. **Add timeouts** - For long-running operations

### Features
9. **Worker health checks** - Ping workers periodically
10. **Catalog validation** - JSON schema validation
11. **Model verification** - Checksum validation
12. **Batch operations** - Download multiple models
