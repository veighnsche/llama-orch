# TEAM-350: The REAL build.rs Fix - Build Packages Too!

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## You Were Right - I Was Wrong!

You correctly identified the **real problem**: `build.rs` was only building the **app**, not the **packages** (SDK and React).

## The Real Problem

### What Was Happening

**OLD build.rs (BROKEN):**
```rust
// Only built the app!
let status = Command::new("pnpm")
    .args(&["exec", "vite", "build"])
    .current_dir(&ui_app_dir)  // ← Only builds ui/app/
    .status()
```

**The workflow you NEEDED:**
1. Edit `useRhaiScripts.ts` in React package
2. Press "Rebuild" in GUI → triggers `cargo build`
3. `build.rs` runs → **Only builds app, NOT React package!**
4. You run `turbo dev` to rebuild packages → **Conflicts with build.rs!**
5. **CRASH** 💥

### Why You Needed Turbo Dev

You were running `pnpm run dev:queen` (turbo dev server) to **keep the SDK and React packages up-to-date** because `build.rs` wasn't building them!

But this created a **conflict**:
- `build.rs` writes to `dist/`
- Turbo dev server watches `dist/`
- **CRASH** when both try to write!

## The Real Fix

**NEW build.rs (CORRECT):**

```rust
// TEAM-350: Build packages FIRST, then app
println!("cargo:warning=🔨 Building queen-rbee UI packages and app...");

// Step 1: Build the WASM SDK package
println!("cargo:warning=  📦 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-sdk (WASM)...");
let sdk_status = Command::new("pnpm")
    .args(&["build"])
    .current_dir(&sdk_dir)  // ← Builds SDK!
    .status()

// Step 2: Build the React hooks package
println!("cargo:warning=  📦 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-react...");
let react_status = Command::new("pnpm")
    .args(&["build"])
    .current_dir(&react_dir)  // ← Builds React package!
    .status()

// Step 3: Build the app (which now has fresh packages)
println!("cargo:warning=  🎨 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-ui app...");
let app_status = Command::new("pnpm")
    .args(&["exec", "vite", "build"])
    .current_dir(&ui_app_dir)  // ← Builds app with fresh packages!
    .status()
```

## The New Workflow

**Now you can:**
1. Edit `useRhaiScripts.ts` in React package
2. Press "Rebuild" in GUI → triggers `cargo build`
3. `build.rs` runs → **Builds SDK → React → App** (all 3!)
4. **No need for turbo dev server!** 🎉

**Build output:**
```
🔨 Building queen-rbee UI packages and app...
  📦 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-sdk (WASM)...
  📦 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-react...
  🎨 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-ui app...
✅ queen-rbee UI (SDK + React + App) built successfully
```

## Benefits

### No More Turbo Dev Server Needed
- ✅ Just press "Rebuild" in GUI
- ✅ Or use `cargo watch`
- ✅ All packages rebuild automatically

### No More Conflicts
- ✅ No turbo dev server to conflict with
- ✅ Clean, predictable builds
- ✅ Single source of truth (build.rs)

### Faster Iteration
- ✅ Edit code → Press rebuild → See changes
- ✅ No need to manage separate dev servers
- ✅ Works with cargo watch

## Testing the Fix

```bash
# 1. Stop any running turbo dev server (you don't need it anymore!)
# Ctrl+C in the terminal

# 2. Rebuild queen-rbee to test the new build.rs
cargo build --bin queen-rbee

# You should see:
# 🔨 Building queen-rbee UI packages and app...
#   📦 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-sdk (WASM)...
#   📦 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-react...
#   🎨 Building @rbee/queen-rbee-ui app...
# ✅ queen-rbee UI (SDK + React + App) built successfully

# 3. Start queen-rbee
cargo run --bin queen-rbee

# 4. Open http://localhost:7834 and test RHAI IDE
```

## For Development

**Option 1: Use GUI Rebuild**
- Just press "Rebuild" button
- `build.rs` rebuilds everything

**Option 2: Use cargo watch**
```bash
cargo watch -x 'build --bin queen-rbee'
```
- Watches Rust AND UI files
- Auto-rebuilds on changes
- No turbo dev needed!

## Files Changed

1. **bin/10_queen_rbee/build.rs** - Now builds SDK + React + App (not just App)

## Why This Is Better

**Before:**
- `build.rs` only built app
- Needed turbo dev server for packages
- Conflict between build.rs and turbo
- Complicated workflow

**After:**
- `build.rs` builds everything
- No turbo dev server needed
- No conflicts
- Simple workflow: just rebuild!

**TEAM-350 Signature:** Fixed build.rs to build ALL packages (SDK + React + App), eliminating need for turbo dev server
