## üéØ KEY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM TEAM-131 REVIEWS

### Answered Unanswered Questions

**For TEAM-132:**
1. ‚úÖ BeehiveNode should move to hive-core
2. ‚úÖ WorkerSpawn types should be shared (create rbee-http-types)
3. ‚úÖ Callback testing: Use wiremock + E2E
4. ‚úÖ ReadyResponse should be shared
5. ‚ùå Command injection fix needs whitelist approach

**For TEAM-134:**
1. ‚úÖ rbee-hive does NOT use SSH (no sharing opportunity)
2. ‚úÖ rbee-hive does make HTTP requests (potential rbee-http-client)
3. ‚úÖ Minimal code duplication (different use cases)

### Gaps Found

**In TEAM-132:**
- secrets-management misrepresented (unused, not partial)
- Test count underreported (20 vs 11)
- Dependency graph missing remote dependency
- LOC math error for remote crate (214 vs 182)

**In TEAM-134:**
- NONE - Investigation was exemplary

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic approach** - Claims inventory ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Gap analysis
2. **Code verification** - Every claim checked against actual code
3. **Tool usage** - cloc, grep, find for verification
4. **Evidence-based** - All findings backed by code snippets

### What Could Improve
1. **Earlier start** - TEAM-134 review was 3 days late
2. **Time management** - Better scheduling of peer reviews
3. **Parallel reviews** - Could have done both simultaneously

### Recommendations for Future Peer Reviews
1. Start peer reviews immediately after investigations complete
2. Use systematic claim extraction approach
3. Verify every LOC count with cloc
4. Check all shared crate usage with grep
5. Answer all unanswered questions
6. Find gaps the investigating team missed
