## üîç PEER REVIEW PROCESS

### Step 1: Claim Inventory & Question Extraction (Day 1 Morning)

**Goal:** Extract every claim the other team made AND identify unanswered questions

**Process:**
1. Read ALL their documents
2. Extract EVERY claim they made
3. Extract EVERY question they left unanswered
4. Categorize claims:
   - Architecture claims (e.g., "module X depends on Y")
   - LOC claims (e.g., "file Z has 500 LOC")
   - Dependency claims (e.g., "uses crate A but not B")
   - Risk claims (e.g., "migration complexity is LOW")
   - Shared crate claims (e.g., "should use auth-min")
5. Categorize questions:
   - Unanswered questions (e.g., "How does X integrate with Y?")
   - TBD items (e.g., "Test coverage: TBD")
   - TODO notes (e.g., "TODO: Verify this")
   - Assumptions without verification (e.g., "Seems reasonable")

**Output:** Claim inventory list + Question inventory list

**Example:**
```markdown
## Claim Inventory: TEAM-132 queen-rbee

### Architecture Claims:
1. "Orchestrator depends on load-balancer and registry" (Report p.5)
2. "HTTP server is independent" (Report p.8)
3. "No circular dependencies" (Report p.12)

### LOC Claims:
1. "orchestrator.rs has 1,200 LOC" (Report p.3)
2. "Total LOC is 3,100" (Report p.2)

### Dependency Claims:
1. "Uses model-catalog for model info" (Report p.15)
2. "Does NOT use auth-min" (Report p.16)

### Risk Claims:
1. "Migration complexity: MEDIUM" (Report p.25)
2. "No breaking changes expected" (Report p.26)

## Question Inventory: TEAM-132 queen-rbee

### Unanswered Questions:
1. "How does queen-rbee handle worker failures?" (Report p.10 - NOT ANSWERED)
2. "What happens when all workers are busy?" (Report p.15 - NOT ANSWERED)
3. "Is there retry logic?" (Report p.18 - NOT ANSWERED)

### TBD Items:
1. "Test coverage: TBD" (Report p.22 - NOT INVESTIGATED)
2. "Integration points: TBD" (Report p.24 - NOT DOCUMENTED)
3. "Performance metrics: TBD" (Report p.27 - NOT MEASURED)

### TODO Notes:
1. "TODO: Verify auth implementation" (Report p.16 - NOT VERIFIED)
2. "TODO: Check error handling" (Report p.19 - NOT CHECKED)

### Assumptions Without Proof:
1. "Seems like it uses auth-min" (Report p.16 - NO PROOF PROVIDED)
2. "Probably handles timeouts correctly" (Report p.21 - NOT VERIFIED)
```

---

### Step 2: Claim Verification & Question Answering (Day 1 Afternoon + Day 2 Morning)

**Goal:** Verify EVERY claim with actual code AND answer unanswered questions

**Process:**
1. For each claim, find the actual code
2. Verify the claim is TRUE
3. If FALSE or INCOMPLETE, document it
4. Collect proof (file paths, line numbers, code snippets)
5. **For each unanswered question, investigate the codebase and answer it**
6. **Provide proof for your answers (code snippets, file locations)**

**Commands to Use:**
```bash
# Count LOC
cloc bin/[binary]/src --by-file

# Find dependencies
grep -r "use " bin/[binary]/src

# Find function calls
grep -rn "function_name" bin/[binary]/src

# Check if shared crate is used
grep -r "auth-min" bin/[binary]/Cargo.toml
grep -r "auth_min" bin/[binary]/src
```

**Output:** Claim verification report

**Example:**
```markdown
## Claim Verification: TEAM-132 queen-rbee

### Claim 1: "orchestrator.rs has 1,200 LOC"
- **Status:** ‚ùå INCORRECT
- **Actual:** 1,087 LOC (verified via cloc)
- **Proof:** 
  ```bash
  $ cloc bin/queen-rbee/src/orchestrator.rs
  Language  files  blank  comment  code
  Rust      1      203    45       1087
  ```
- **Impact:** LOC estimate off by ~10%, affects effort estimate

### Claim 2: "Uses model-catalog for model info"
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY TRUE
- **Actual:** model-catalog is in Cargo.toml but barely used
- **Proof:**
  ```bash
  $ grep -r "model_catalog" bin/queen-rbee/src
  bin/queen-rbee/src/orchestrator.rs:5:use model_catalog::ModelInfo;
  bin/queen-rbee/src/orchestrator.rs:127:// TODO: Use ModelInfo
  ```
- **Impact:** Shared crate not fully utilized, opportunity missed

### Claim 3: "No circular dependencies"
- **Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Proof:** Analyzed all `use` statements, no cycles found
- **Method:** Created dependency graph (see attached)

## Question Answering: TEAM-132 queen-rbee

### Question 1: "How does queen-rbee handle worker failures?"
- **Original Status:** NOT ANSWERED (Report p.10)
- **Our Answer:** ‚úÖ ANSWERED
- **Finding:** Implemented in `src/orchestrator.rs:156-189`
- **Proof:**
  ```rust
  // File: bin/queen-rbee/src/orchestrator.rs
  // Lines: 156-189
  async fn handle_worker_failure(&self, worker_id: &str) -> Result<()> {
      warn!("Worker {} failed, removing from registry", worker_id);
      self.registry.deregister(worker_id).await?;
      Ok(())
  }
  ```
- **Impact:** Team 132 missed this critical error handling logic

### Question 2: "What happens when all workers are busy?"
- **Original Status:** NOT ANSWERED (Report p.15)
- **Our Answer:** ‚úÖ ANSWERED
- **Finding:** Request queues with timeout in `src/load_balancer.rs:92-105`
- **Proof:** [code snippet showing queue implementation]
- **Impact:** Important architectural detail missed

### Question 3: "TODO: Verify auth implementation"
- **Original Status:** NOT VERIFIED (Report p.16)
- **Our Verification:** ‚ùå AUTH NOT IMPLEMENTED!
- **Finding:** auth-min is in Cargo.toml but NEVER USED
- **Proof:**
  ```bash
  $ grep -r "auth_min" bin/queen-rbee/src
  [no results]
  ```
- **Impact:** CRITICAL SECURITY GAP!
```

---

### Step 3: Gap Analysis (Day 2 Afternoon)

**Goal:** Find what the other team MISSED

**Areas to Check:**

#### 3.1 Missing Files
- [ ] Did they analyze ALL files?
- [ ] Did they count ALL LOC?
- [ ] Are there hidden modules?

**How to Check:**
```bash
# List all Rust files
find bin/[binary]/src -name "*.rs" -type f

# Compare with their file list
# Any files missing from their report?
```

#### 3.2 Missing Dependencies
- [ ] Did they audit ALL Cargo.toml dependencies?
- [ ] Did they check workspace dependencies?
- [ ] Did they find all `use` statements?

**How to Check:**
```bash
# List all dependencies
cat bin/[binary]/Cargo.toml | grep -A 100 "[dependencies]"

# Find all use statements
grep -rh "^use " bin/[binary]/src | sort | uniq
```

#### 3.3 Missing Shared Crate Opportunities ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL!

**üîç ACTIVELY SEARCH FOR ALL SHARED CRATES!**

- [ ] Did they check ALL 10+ shared crates?
- [ ] Did they find duplicate code?
- [ ] Did they identify consolidation opportunities?
- [ ] Did they verify shared crate usage claims?
- [ ] Did they find shared crates in Cargo.toml but not used?

**Complete Shared Crate List to Check:**
1. `hive-core` - Core hive types
2. `model-catalog` - Model management
3. `gpu-info` - GPU detection
4. `auth-min` - Authentication
5. `secrets-management` - Secrets
6. `input-validation` - Input validation
7. `audit-logging` - Audit logs
8. `deadline-propagation` - Deadlines
9. `narration-core` - Observability
10. `jwt-guardian` - JWT handling

**How to Check (DO THIS FOR EVERY SHARED CRATE!):**
```bash
# Step 1: List ALL shared crates
ls -la shared-crates/

# Step 2: For EACH shared crate, check if it's in Cargo.toml
grep -r "shared-crate-name" bin/[binary]/Cargo.toml

# Step 3: For EACH shared crate, check if it's actually USED in code
grep -r "shared_crate_name" bin/[binary]/src

# Step 4: Identify gaps
# - In Cargo.toml but NOT in src/ = UNUSED DEPENDENCY
# - NOT in Cargo.toml but SHOULD BE = MISSED OPPORTUNITY
# - In src/ but barely used = UNDERUTILIZED

# Example: Complete auth-min audit
echo "=== Checking auth-min ==="
grep -r "auth-min" bin/[binary]/Cargo.toml
echo "Cargo.toml result: $?"

grep -rn "auth_min" bin/[binary]/src
echo "Source usage result: $?"

grep -rn "use auth" bin/[binary]/src
echo "Auth import result: $?"

# Example: Search for authentication code that SHOULD use auth-min
grep -rn "bearer" bin/[binary]/src -i
grep -rn "token" bin/[binary]/src -i
grep -rn "authorization" bin/[binary]/src -i
# If you find auth code but NO auth-min usage = GAP!
```

**Questions to Answer for EACH Shared Crate:**

1. **Is it in Cargo.toml?** YES/NO
2. **Is it used in src/?** YES/NO  
3. **How many times is it used?** (count grep results)
4. **Is usage appropriate?** FULL/PARTIAL/NONE
5. **Should it be used more?** YES/NO
6. **Is there duplicate code it could replace?** YES/NO

**Document Your Findings:**
```markdown
### Shared Crate Audit: auth-min

**In Cargo.toml:** ‚úÖ YES (line 23)
**Used in src/:** ‚ùå NO
**Usage count:** 0 occurrences
**Appropriateness:** ‚ùå NONE - Should be used!

**Evidence of missed opportunity:**
- Found manual bearer token parsing in src/http/middleware.rs:45
- Found manual auth header checking in src/http/routes.rs:89
- Found TODO comment "use auth-min here" in src/orchestrator.rs:127

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Auth not properly implemented!
**Recommendation:** MUST use auth-min for all authentication

---

### Shared Crate Audit: model-catalog

**In Cargo.toml:** ‚úÖ YES (line 25)
**Used in src/:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY
**Usage count:** 2 occurrences (barely used)
**Appropriateness:** ‚ö†Ô∏è UNDERUTILIZED

**Evidence:**
- Only used for type import: `use model_catalog::ModelInfo`
- Model info is duplicated in src/types/mod.rs
- Should query catalog for model metadata

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Duplicate code exists
**Recommendation:** Use model-catalog more extensively
```

#### 3.4 Missing Integration Points
- [ ] Did they document how binary talks to other binaries?
- [ ] Did they check for shared types?
- [ ] Did they identify API contracts?

**How to Check:**
```bash
# Find HTTP client calls (integration points)
grep -rn "reqwest" bin/[binary]/src
grep -rn "Client::new" bin/[binary]/src

# Find shared types
grep -rn "::types::" bin/[binary]/src
```

#### 3.5 Missing Risks
- [ ] Did they identify ALL breaking changes?
- [ ] Did they assess test coverage?
- [ ] Did they consider rollback scenarios?

**How to Check:**
```bash
# Check test coverage
find bin/[binary] -name "*test*" -o -name "*tests*"

# Count test files vs source files
# Low ratio = HIGH RISK!
```

#### 3.6 Missing Circular Dependencies
- [ ] Did they actually verify no circular deps?
- [ ] Did they check module-level dependencies?
- [ ] Did they create a dependency graph?

**How to Check:**
```bash
# Extract all module dependencies
grep -rh "^use crate::" bin/[binary]/src | sort | uniq

# Build dependency graph manually
# Look for cycles!
```

**Output:** Gap analysis report

**Example:**
```markdown
## Gap Analysis: TEAM-132 queen-rbee

### Missing Files:
‚ùå **CRITICAL:** Team 132 missed `src/preflight/` directory!
- Files: `preflight/mod.rs`, `preflight/rbee_hive.rs`, `preflight/ssh.rs`
- Total LOC: ~200
- Impact: LOC estimate off by ~6%, affects architecture

### Missing Dependencies:
‚ö†Ô∏è Team 132 did NOT check workspace dependencies!
- Workspace deps: `tokio`, `reqwest`, `serde` (inherited)
- Impact: Incomplete dependency analysis

### Missing Shared Crate Opportunities:
‚ùå **MAJOR GAP:** `audit-logging` is in Cargo.toml but NEVER USED!
- Proof: 
  ```bash
  $ grep -r "audit_logging" bin/queen-rbee/Cargo.toml
  audit-logging = { path = "../shared-crates/audit-logging" }
  
  $ grep -r "audit_logging" bin/queen-rbee/src
  [no results]
  ```
- Recommendation: Either use it or remove it!

### Missing Integration Points:
‚ö†Ô∏è Team 132 did NOT document how queen-rbee talks to llm-worker-rbee!
- Found: HTTP client calls to worker endpoints (src/orchestrator.rs:245)
- Missing: Request/response format documentation
- Impact: Integration risks not assessed

### Missing Risks:
‚ùå **CRITICAL:** No test coverage analysis!
- Team 132 claimed "good test coverage" but provided NO PROOF
- Actual: Only 3 test files found in entire codebase
- Impact: Migration risk severely underestimated

### Missing Circular Dependencies:
‚úÖ Team 132 correctly identified no circular dependencies
- Verified independently
- No gaps found in this area
```
