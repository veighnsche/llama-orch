**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

Created complete directory structure and scaffolding for the new crate-based architecture.

**Starting State:** All binaries renamed to `*.bak`  
**Final State:** New crate structure with proper Cargo.toml files and lib.rs stubs  
**Reference:** `TEAM_130G_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 📊 DELIVERABLES COMPLETED

### ✅ 1. Shared Crates (3 crates)

```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Workspace Integration
Updated `/home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/Cargo.toml`:
- Added all 26 new crates to workspace members
- Organized by category (binaries, binary-specific crates, shared crates)
- Added TEAM-135 comments for traceability

### Dependencies Added
- `tokio` added to queen-rbee, rbee-hive, llm-worker-rbee (for async main)
- All other dependencies marked as "Add dependencies as needed"

### Naming Conventions
- **Package names:** kebab-case (e.g., `daemon-lifecycle`)
- **Lib names:** snake_case (e.g., `daemon_lifecycle`)
- **Directory names:** kebab-case (e.g., `daemon-lifecycle/`)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES FOLLOWED

### 1. SSH Location ✅
- ✅ `queen-rbee-crates/ssh-client/` (correct)
- ❌ `shared-crates/rbee-ssh-client/` (NOT created)

**Rationale:** Only queen-rbee uses SSH

### 2. NO CLI in rbee-hive ✅
- ✅ `rbee-hive/src/main.rs` with daemon args only
- ❌ `rbee-hive-crates/cli/` (NOT created)

**Rationale:** rbee-hive is daemon-only, managed via HTTP API

### 3. backend/ in Binary ✅
- ✅ `llm-worker-rbee/src/backend/` (correct)
- ❌ `llm-worker-rbee-crates/backend/` (NOT created)

**Rationale:** LLM-specific inference logic stays in binary

### 4. .bak Preservation ✅
- ✅ `rbee-keeper.bak/` preserved
- ✅ `queen-rbee.bak/` preserved
- ✅ `rbee-hive.bak/` preserved
- ✅ `llm-worker-rbee.bak/` preserved

**Rationale:** Reference for migration (TEAM-136)

## 📝 HANDOFF TO TEAM-136

### What TEAM-135 Delivered
1. ✅ Complete directory structure (26 directories)
2. ✅ All Cargo.toml files with proper metadata
3. ✅ All lib.rs stubs with TEAM-135 signatures
4. ✅ All README.md files with status and purpose
5. ✅ Workspace Cargo.toml updated
6. ✅ Compilation verified (cargo check passes)
7. ✅ All critical rules enforced
8. ✅ .bak directories preserved

### What TEAM-136 Must Do
1. Migrate code from `*.bak` binaries to new crate structure
2. Implement shared crate functionality (daemon-lifecycle, rbee-http-client, rbee-types)
3. Remove violations from old code (if any)
4. Test compilation after migration
5. Update dependencies in Cargo.toml files

### Migration Priority
1. **Phase 1:** Shared crates (daemon-lifecycle, rbee-http-client, rbee-types)
2. **Phase 2:** rbee-keeper (simplest, CLI only)
3. **Phase 3:** llm-worker-rbee (backend stays in binary)
4. **Phase 4:** rbee-hive (daemon only, NO CLI)
5. **Phase 5:** queen-rbee (most complex, SSH + lifecycle)
