# TEAM-353: Hive UI Migration - COMPLETE

**Date:** Oct 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Dependencies ✅
- Added TanStack Query to rbee-hive-react
- Added shared packages to app

### 2. Hooks Migration ✅
- Migrated useModels to TanStack Query
- Migrated useWorkers to TanStack Query with auto-polling
- Added QueryClient to App.tsx

### 3. Rust WASM SDK ✅
- Built rbee-hive-sdk as Rust WASM (same pattern as queen-rbee-sdk)
- Uses job-client for job-based architecture
- Wraps operations-contract

### 4. Hooks Updated ✅
- Updated to use WASM SDK
- Properly passes hive_id (network address, NOT localhost)
- Uses client.hiveId from window.location.hostname

### 5. Architecture ✅
- Queen: localhost (manages network)
- Hives: network addresses (192.168.x.x, etc.)
- Hive UI: served BY the Hive, uses window.location.hostname
- All operations include hive_id parameter

## Files Changed

### SDK (Rust WASM)
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-sdk/Cargo.toml`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-sdk/src/lib.rs`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-sdk/src/client.rs`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-sdk/src/operations.rs`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-sdk/src/conversions.rs`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-sdk/package.json`

### React Hooks
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-react/src/index.ts`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/packages/rbee-hive-react/package.json`

### App
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/app/src/App.tsx`
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/ui/app/package.json`

## Build Status

✅ rbee-hive-sdk builds (WASM)  
✅ rbee-hive-react builds  
✅ Hive UI app builds (219 KB)

## Key Architecture Points

1. **Job-based architecture** - All operations go through `/v1/jobs`
2. **Network-aware** - hive_id is the network address (NOT localhost)
3. **Self-aware** - Hive UI uses `window.location.hostname` to get its own address
4. **WASM SDK** - Same pattern as Queen SDK, wraps job-client
