# TEAM-353: Worker UI Migration - COMPLETE

**Date:** Oct 30, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Dependencies âœ…
- Added TanStack Query to llm-worker-react
- Added shared packages to app

### 2. Rust WASM SDK âœ…
- Built llm-worker-sdk as Rust WASM
- Uses job-client for job-based architecture
- Wraps operations-contract
- **Excluded job-server** (causes WASM build issues with tokio/mio)

### 3. Hooks Migration âœ…
- Migrated useInference to TanStack Query (useMutation)
- Updated to use WASM SDK
- Uses client.workerId from window.location.hostname

### 4. Architecture âœ…
- Worker UI: served BY the worker, uses window.location.hostname
- worker_id: network address (192.168.x.x, etc.)
- All operations go through `/v1/jobs`

---

## Files Changed

### SDK (Rust WASM)
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-sdk/Cargo.toml`
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-sdk/src/lib.rs`
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-sdk/src/client.rs`
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-sdk/src/conversions.rs`
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-sdk/package.json`

### React Hooks
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-react/src/index.ts`
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/packages/llm-worker-react/package.json`

### App
- `bin/30_llm_worker_rbee/ui/app/package.json`

## Build Status

âœ… llm-worker-sdk builds (WASM)  
âœ… llm-worker-react builds  
âœ… Worker UI app builds (193 KB)  

---

## Key Points

1. **Job-based architecture** - All operations go through `/v1/jobs`
2. **Network-aware** - worker_id is the network address
3. **Self-aware** - Worker UI uses `window.location.hostname`
4. **WASM SDK** - Same pattern as Hive/Queen SDKs, wraps job-client
5. **No job-server** - Excluded from WASM build (tokio incompatibility)
