# UI Implementation Roadmap

**Created:** October 29, 2025  
**Based On:** TEAM-350 Learnings  
**Total Teams:** 5 (TEAM-351 through TEAM-355)  
**Estimated Duration:** 8-10 days total

---

## Overview

This roadmap breaks down the complete UI implementation into 5 distinct phases. Each phase has its own comprehensive document with step-by-step instructions.

**Goal:** Implement Queen, Hive, and Worker UIs with zero code duplication using shared packages.

---

## Phase Breakdown

### üèóÔ∏è TEAM-351: Shared Packages Creation (2-3 days)

**Status:** üîú TODO  
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Blocks all other phases)  
**Document:** `TEAM_351_SHARED_PACKAGES_PHASE.md`

**Mission:** Create 4 reusable packages that eliminate duplication.

**Deliverables:**
- `@rbee/shared-config` - Port configuration (single source of truth)
- `@rbee/narration-client` - Narration SSE handling
- `@rbee/iframe-bridge` - iframe ‚Üî parent communication
- `@rbee/dev-utils` - Environment detection utilities
- Rust constants generator

**Why First:** All other phases depend on these packages.

---

### ‚úÖ TEAM-352: Queen UI Migration (1 day)

**Status:** üîú TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Dependencies:** TEAM-351  
**Document:** `TEAM_352_QUEEN_MIGRATION_PHASE.md`

**Mission:** Migrate Queen UI from duplicate code to shared packages.

**Deliverables:**
- Queen UI uses `@rbee/narration-client`
- Keeper uses `@rbee/shared-config` for iframe URLs
- Keeper uses `@rbee/shared-config` for allowed origins
- ~110 LOC removed (85% reduction)
- Pattern validated

**Why Second:** Validates shared packages work before Hive/Worker use them.

---

### üèóÔ∏è TEAM-353: Hive UI Implementation (2-3 days)

**Status:** üîú TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Dependencies:** TEAM-351, TEAM-352  
**Document:** `TEAM_353_HIVE_UI_PHASE.md`

**Mission:** Implement Hive UI from scratch using shared packages.

**Deliverables:**
- Hive WASM SDK package
- Hive React hooks package
- Hive Vite app
- build.rs for Hive
- Keeper HivePage
- ~120 LOC saved (96% reduction vs duplicating)

**Why Third:** First new service using proven pattern.

---

### üèóÔ∏è TEAM-354: Worker UI Implementation (2-3 days)

**Status:** üîú TODO  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Dependencies:** TEAM-351, TEAM-352, TEAM-353  
**Document:** `TEAM_354_WORKER_UI_PHASE.md`

**Mission:** Implement Worker UI using proven pattern.

**Deliverables:**
- Worker WASM SDK package
- Worker React hooks package
- Worker Vite app
- build.rs for Worker
- Keeper WorkerPage
- Complete UI suite (Keeper, Queen, Hive, Worker)

**Why Fourth:** Final service completes the suite.

---

### üìö TEAM-355: Final Documentation (1 day)

**Status:** üîú TODO  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Dependencies:** TEAM-351, 352, 353, 354  
**Document:** `TEAM_355_FINAL_DOCUMENTATION_PHASE.md`

**Mission:** Create comprehensive documentation and close out project.

**Deliverables:**
- Updated PORT_CONFIGURATION.md
- Architecture diagrams
- Quick start guide
- Shared package documentation
- TEAM-350 archive
- Final handoff summary

**Why Last:** Documents the complete implementation.

## Quick Reference

### Port Allocation

| Service | Dev  | Prod | Backend |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| Keeper  | 5173 | Tauri| N/A     |
| Queen   | 7834 | 7833 | 7833    |
| Hive    | 7836 | 7835 | 7835    |
| Worker  | 7837 | 8080 | 8080    |

### Shared Packages

1. **@rbee/shared-config** - Port management
2. **@rbee/narration-client** - Narration handling
3. **@rbee/iframe-bridge** - Communication
4. **@rbee/dev-utils** - Utilities

### Code Savings

- **Per Service:** ~120 LOC saved
- **3 Services:** ~360 LOC total saved
- **Maintenance:** 40% reduction

## Team Instructions

### For Each Team

1. **Read your phase document** - Comprehensive step-by-step guide
2. **Read prerequisite docs** - Listed in your phase document
3. **Follow the checklist** - Every deliverable listed
4. **Test both modes** - Development and production
5. **Create handoff doc** - Summary for next team

### Critical Rules

üö® **Never hardcode ports** - Use `@rbee/shared-config`  
üö® **Never duplicate code** - Use shared packages  
üö® **Test both modes** - Dev and prod must work  
üö® **Update all locations** - When adding services
