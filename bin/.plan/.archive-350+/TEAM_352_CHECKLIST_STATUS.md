## ✅ VERIFIED - Dependency Usage

### React Query in queen-rbee-react

**Status:** ✅ CORRECTLY USED

**File:** `bin/10_queen_rbee/ui/packages/queen-rbee-react/src/hooks/useRhaiScripts.ts`

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const {
  data: scripts,
  isLoading: loading,
  error,
  refetch: loadScripts,
} = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['rhai-scripts', baseUrl],
  queryFn: async () => { ... },
  enabled: !!sdk,
})
```

**Verdict:** ✅ KEEP - Actually used for async state management

### React Query in react-hooks

**Status:** ✅ NOT USED (only documentation comment)

**File:** `frontend/packages/react-hooks/src/index.ts`

**Content:**
```typescript
/**
 * For async data fetching, use TanStack Query directly:
 * import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query'
 */
```

**Verdict:** ✅ CORRECT - Just documentation, no actual import
