# TEAM-221: worker-lifecycle NARRATION INVENTORY

**Component:** `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle`  
**Date:** Oct 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

worker-lifecycle is a **STUB** - not yet implemented.

**File:** `src/lib.rs` (13 lines)

```rust
// TEAM-135: Created by TEAM-135 (scaffolding)
// Purpose: Lifecycle management for LLM worker instances
// Status: STUB - Awaiting implementation

// TODO: Implement worker lifecycle functionality
```

---

## Findings

### ‚ùå No Implementation
- Crate exists but contains only TODO marker
- No narration code
- No functionality

### üìã Recommendations

When implementing worker-lifecycle, follow hive-lifecycle pattern:

1. **Use NarrationFactory pattern:**
   ```rust
   const NARRATE: NarrationFactory = NarrationFactory::new("wkr-life");
   ```

2. **Include job_id in ALL narrations:**
   ```rust
   NARRATE
       .action("worker_spawn")
       .job_id(&job_id)  // ‚Üê CRITICAL for SSE routing
       .context(worker_id)
       .human("üöÄ Spawning worker '{}'")
       .emit();
   ```

3. **Expected operations:**
   - `execute_worker_spawn()` - Spawn worker process
   - `execute_worker_stop()` - Stop worker process
   - `execute_worker_list()` - List workers
   - `execute_worker_get()` - Get worker details
   - `execute_worker_delete()` - Delete worker

4. **Expected narrations:**
   - Worker spawn (check running, resolve binary, spawn, health poll)
   - Worker stop (graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
   - Worker status (health check)
   - Worker list (enumerate workers)
   - Worker get (fetch details)

5. **Integration with TimeoutEnforcer:**
   ```rust
   TimeoutEnforcer::new(Duration::from_secs(30))
       .with_job_id(&job_id)  // ‚Üê CRITICAL for SSE routing
       .with_countdown()
       .enforce(async {
           // Worker spawn logic
       })
       .await?;
   ```

## Code Signatures

```rust
// TEAM-221: Investigated - Stub only, no implementation
```

**Files investigated:**
- `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` (13 lines)

---

**TEAM-221 COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**CRITICAL FINDING:** worker-lifecycle is a stub. When implemented, it MUST follow hive-lifecycle's pattern with `.job_id(&job_id)` in ALL narrations.
