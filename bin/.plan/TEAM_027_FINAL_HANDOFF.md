## What Needs QA

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: TEAM-028 Must Be Skeptical

**TEAM-027 implemented quickly. Assume bugs exist.**

### Known Incomplete

- ‚ùå Phase 7: Worker ready polling (stubbed)
- ‚ùå Phase 8: Inference execution (stubbed)
- ‚ùå End-to-end testing (script created, not run)
- ‚ùå Integration testing (not done)
- ‚ùå Edge case handling (not tested)

### Known Untested

- Worker spawn with real worker
- Background loop stability
- Error handling edge cases
- Concurrent access
- Resource cleanup
- Performance under load

## Key Decisions Made

1. **worker-registry is now shared** - Used by queen-rbee and rbee-keeper
2. **pool-core renamed to hive-core** - Better naming
3. **auth-min kept** - Security infrastructure for future
4. **2 crates deleted** - pool-registry-types, orchestrator-core
5. **10 crates kept** - All have future value

---

## Final Message to TEAM-028

**Be skeptical. Test everything. Find bugs.**

We built the infrastructure quickly. It compiles and basic tests pass, but:
- We didn't test with real workers
- We didn't stress test background loops
- We didn't test error cases thoroughly
- We didn't test edge cases at all
- We didn't run end-to-end tests

**Your job:**
1. Verify our work (assume bugs exist)
2. Complete Phase 7-8
3. Test end-to-end
4. Integrate shared crates
5. Fix bugs you find

**Read the QA handoff first:** `TEAM_028_HANDOFF_FINAL.md`

It has:
- Detailed QA checklist
- Red flags to watch for
- Questions to ask
- Integration opportunities
- Testing strategy

**Good luck, and don't trust us!** üîç
