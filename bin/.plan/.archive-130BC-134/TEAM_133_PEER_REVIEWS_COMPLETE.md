## üìä KEY INSIGHTS FROM PEER REVIEWS

### What Makes a Great Investigation:

**TEAM-134 Excellence:**
- ‚úÖ 100% accurate LOC counting
- ‚úÖ Proactive bug discovery (found 2 bugs!)
- ‚úÖ 82% shared crate audit coverage
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture documentation
- ‚úÖ Realistic migration plans

**TEAM-132 Gaps:**
- ‚ùå Incomplete shared crate audit (45%)
- ‚ùå Missed critical integrations (narration-core)
- ‚ùå Didn't verify recommendations (hive-core)
- ‚ùå Declared dependencies not used

### Cross-Team Patterns Observed:

1. **narration-core is critical** - TEAM-133 uses it 15√ó, but others ignore it
2. **hive-core needs investigation** - BeehiveNode duplicated across binaries
3. **Unused dependencies** - secrets-management and input-validation declared but not used
4. **Type sharing opportunity** - All binaries define BeehiveNode locally
