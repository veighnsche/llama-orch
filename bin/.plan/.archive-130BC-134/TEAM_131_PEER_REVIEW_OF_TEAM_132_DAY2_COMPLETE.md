# TEAM-131 PEER REVIEW OF TEAM-132: Day 2 Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Phase:** Day 2 - Questions Answered & Gap Analysis Complete

---

## QUESTIONS ANSWERED (7/7)

### 1. Can we share BeehiveNode type in hive-core?
**Answer:** ✅ YES
- hive-core exists at `/bin/shared-crates/hive-core`
- BeehiveNode currently in queen-rbee only
- Should move to hive-core for reuse

### 2. Can we share WorkerSpawnRequest/Response types?
**Answer:** ✅ YES  
- Types duplicated across queen-rbee and rbee-hive
- Recommend: Create `rbee-http-types` shared crate

### 3. Best way to test rbee-hive callbacks?
**Answer:** ✅ Use wiremock + E2E tests
- Option 1: wiremock for fast unit tests
- Option 2: Real rbee-hive for integration tests

### 4. Should we extract ReadyResponse?
**Answer:** ✅ YES
- Include in `rbee-http-types` shared crate

### 5-6. Worker/CLI imports?
**Answer:** ⏳ Need TEAM-133 and TEAM-134 to investigate

### 7. Is command injection fix adequate?
**Answer:** ❌ NO - Needs improvement
- Proposed fix has gaps (misses `$()`, backticks, etc.)
- Recommend: Whitelist approach with enum OR structured command builder

## GAPS FOUND

1. **Test count wrong**: Claimed 11, actually 20 tests (missed main.rs tests)
2. **secrets-management overclaimed**: Said "partial" but actually unused
3. **Dependency graph incomplete**: http-server also depends on remote (not just registry)
4. **LOC math error**: queen-rbee-remote = 214 LOC not 182 (32 LOC discrepancy)
5. **Preflight stub confirmed**: ssh.rs has mock implementation (correctly identified by TEAM-132)

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ✅ TEAM-132 Strengths
- Perfect LOC analysis (all 17 files correct)
- All 5 features verified to exist
- Correctly identified command injection vulnerability
- Good shared crate assessment (4/5 correct)

### ❌ TEAM-132 Weaknesses
- secrets-management status misrepresented
- Test count underreported by 9 tests
- Dependency graph missing remote dependency
- LOC calculation error for remote crate
