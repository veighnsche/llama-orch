# TEAM-130B: FINAL SYNTHESIS TEAM

**Role:** Consolidate all investigations and peer reviews into definitive, actionable investigation files

**Duration:** 9-12 days (3 phases)

**Team Size:** 2-3 people

**Approach:** Phased execution with full context

---

## 🎯 Mission

Create **FOUR FINAL INVESTIGATION FILES** (one per binary) that synthesize:
- Original investigations (Teams 131, 132, 133, 134)
- Peer reviews (8 reviews total)
- Cross-binary shared crate analysis
- External Rust library recommendations

**Focus:** CRATE DESIGN, not binary functionality

## 📚 Documents to Read

**🚨 CONFUSED? Read:** `TEAM_130B_NAVIGATION.md` - Document guide with clear navigation

**⭐ PRIMARY EXECUTION GUIDE:**
1. **TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md** - YOUR MAIN GUIDE (3 phases, 9-12 days, 13 files)

**📖 Reference Documents (read as needed):**
2. **TEAM_130B_EXAMPLE_STRUCTURE.md** - File structure template
3. **TEAM_130B_RUST_LIBRARY_SUGGESTIONS.md** - Library recommendations
4. **TEAM_130B_SUMMARY.md** - Quick executive summary
5. **TEAM_130B_FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md** - ⚠️ Detailed methodology (REFERENCE ONLY)

**⚠️ WARNING:** Don't read TEAM_130B_FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md as an execution guide! It's detailed methodology reference only. Use TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md for execution!

## 📋 Input Documents (20+ files)

**Read ALL of these:**
- 4 teams × 4+ documents = 16+ investigation docs
- 4 teams × 2 reviews each = 8 peer review docs
- **Total: ~24 documents to analyze**

---

## 📊 Deliverables (13 files, ~220 pages)

### Phase 1: Cross-Binary Analysis (1 file):

1. **TEAM_130B_CROSS_BINARY_ANALYSIS.md** (20-25 pages)
   - Complete system overview
   - Shared crate usage across ALL 4 binaries
   - Cross-binary opportunities
   - Workspace-level recommendations

### Phase 2 & 3: Per-Binary Investigations (12 files)

**Each binary split into 3 parts to avoid token limits:**

#### rbee-hive (3 files):
2. **PART1_METRICS.md** (15-20 pages) - Ground truth, 10 crates detailed
3. **PART2_LIBRARIES.md** (15-20 pages) - Shared crates, external libraries
4. **PART3_MIGRATION.md** (10-15 pages) - Migration strategy, risks, approval

#### queen-rbee (3 files):
5. **PART1_METRICS.md** (15-20 pages) - Ground truth, 4 crates detailed
6. **PART2_LIBRARIES.md** (15-20 pages) - CRITICAL: auth-min, russh fixes
7. **PART3_MIGRATION.md** (10-15 pages) - Migration strategy, risks, approval

#### llm-worker-rbee (3 files):
8. **PART1_METRICS.md** (15-20 pages) - Ground truth, 6 crates detailed
9. **PART2_LIBRARIES.md** (15-20 pages) - Performance libs (simd-json)
10. **PART3_MIGRATION.md** (10-15 pages) - Migration strategy, risks, approval

#### rbee-keeper (3 files):
11. **PART1_METRICS.md** (15-20 pages) - Ground truth, 5 crates detailed
12. **PART2_LIBRARIES.md** (15-20 pages) - CLI libs (clap, indicatif, etc.)
13. **PART3_MIGRATION.md** (10-15 pages) - Migration strategy, risks, approval

**Total: 13 files, ~220 pages (manageable chunks!)**

## 🔍 Key Responsibilities

### 1. Reconcile Conflicts
- Compare original investigations vs peer reviews
- Run your own verification (cloc, grep, cargo tree)
- Determine ground truth
- Document resolutions

### 2. Cross-Binary Analysis ⚠️ CRITICAL
- Analyze shared crate usage across ALL 4 binaries
- Identify patterns and gaps
- Recommend standardization
- Estimate cross-binary migration effort

**Example:**
```
auth-min usage:
- rbee-hive: ✅ FULL (good!)
- queen-rbee: ❌ NONE (manual auth - SECURITY RISK!)
- llm-worker-rbee: ❌ NONE (prepare for future)
- rbee-keeper: ⚠️ PARTIAL (expand usage)

→ Recommendation: Standardize auth-min across all binaries
→ Effort: 6-8 hours total
→ Priority: CRITICAL
```

### 3. External Library Research
- Suggest 5+ Rust libraries per binary
- Provide concrete versions
- Show code examples
- Estimate migration effort
- Prioritize recommendations

**Categories:**
- Testing (rstest, proptest, wiremock)
- CLI (clap, indicatif, console, dialoguer)
- SSH (russh - CRITICAL security fix)
- Observability (metrics, tracing-opentelemetry)
- Configuration (figment)
- Secrets (secrecy, keyring)
- Performance (simd-json)

### 4. Make It Actionable
- Step-by-step migration plans
- Exact bash commands
- Time estimates for each step
- Validation criteria
- Rollback plans

**NOT acceptable:**
> "Move files to new crates"

**Acceptable:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create crate skeleton (30 min)
mkdir -p bin/rbee-keeper-crates/pool-client/src
cat > bin/rbee-keeper-crates/pool-client/Cargo.toml <<EOF
[package]
name = "pool-client"
version = "0.1.0"
EOF

# Step 2: Move files (1 hour)
git mv bin/rbee-keeper/src/pool_client.rs \
       bin/rbee-keeper-crates/pool-client/src/lib.rs

# Step 3: Validate (5 min)
cargo build -p pool-client
cargo test -p pool-client
```

## ✅ Quality Standards

### Each Final Investigation Must Have:

**Verified Metrics:**
- [ ] LOC counts verified with cloc (not just copied)
- [ ] Dependencies verified with cargo tree
- [ ] Architecture verified with code analysis

**Reconciled Findings:**
- [ ] All conflicts resolved
- [ ] Ground truth established
- [ ] Discrepancies documented

**Complete Shared Crate Analysis:**
- [ ] ALL 10+ shared crates analyzed
- [ ] Usage in ALL 4 binaries documented
- [ ] Cross-binary opportunities identified

**External Library Recommendations:**
- [ ] At least 5 recommendations per binary
- [ ] Concrete versions and code examples
- [ ] Migration effort estimated

**Actionable Migration Plan:**
- [ ] Step-by-step with commands
- [ ] Time estimates
- [ ] Validation criteria
- [ ] Rollback plan

**All Questions Answered:**
- [ ] Every open question addressed
- [ ] Every TBD investigated
- [ ] Every assumption verified

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Just copy-paste investigations
- ❌ Leave conflicts unresolved
- ❌ Skip shared crate audit
- ❌ Give vague recommendations ("use better libraries")
- ❌ Skip verification ("team X said it's 500 LOC so it must be")
- ❌ Focus only on single binary (miss cross-binary opportunities)

**DO:**
- ✅ Verify everything independently
- ✅ Think cross-binary
- ✅ Be specific and actionable
- ✅ Provide code examples
- ✅ Estimate effort
- ✅ Prioritize recommendations
