## Review 1: TEAM-131 (rbee-hive)

**File:** `TEAM_132_PEER_REVIEW_OF_TEAM_131.md`

### Verdict: ‚úÖ **PASS WITH MINOR CORRECTIONS**

### Critical Finding:

**‚ùå audit-logging incorrectly marked as "NOT USED"**
- TEAM-131 claimed audit-logging is unused
- **We found 14+ usages** across 3 files (daemon.rs, auth.rs, routes.rs)
- Impact: Audit summary counts are wrong

### Required Corrections:

1. **Fix audit-logging claim** - Move to "WELL-USED" section
2. **Clarify LOC discrepancy** - Use consistent numbers (6,142 vs 6,021)
3. **Verify test coverage** - Provide actual data or mark as TBD

### Positive Findings:

- ‚úÖ All 4,184 code LOC verified
- ‚úÖ Excellent file structure analysis (34 files)
- ‚úÖ Well-structured 10 crate proposals
- ‚úÖ Good shared crate audit (except audit-logging error)
- ‚úÖ Strong justifications for crate boundaries

### Gaps Identified:

1. **narration-core missing** from Cargo.toml (should add)
2. **Integration points** not fully documented
3. **4 additional risks** not identified (process spawn, registry corruption, disk space, stale PIDs)
4. **Test coverage unverified** (claims ~60% without proof)

**Overall Score:** 90/100

## Review 2: TEAM-133 (llm-worker-rbee)

**File:** `TEAM_132_PEER_REVIEW_OF_TEAM_133.md`

### Verdict: ‚úÖ **APPROVED - EXCELLENT WORK**

### Highlights:

- ‚úÖ **LOC perfect match:** 5,026 exactly matches cloc
- ‚úÖ **Outstanding reusability analysis:** 85% reusable across future workers
- ‚úÖ **Brilliant generic design:** InferenceEvent<T> and InferenceBackend trait
- ‚úÖ **Excellent documentation:** Reusability matrix is best we've seen
- ‚úÖ **Proven approach:** worker-rbee-error pilot already successful

### Findings (Not Blocking):

1. **input-validation** in Cargo.toml but NOT used (691 LOC should be replaced)
2. **secrets-management** in Cargo.toml but NOT used
3. **model-catalog missing** from Cargo.toml (should add)
4. **gpu-info missing** from Cargo.toml (should add)
5. **deadline-propagation** not in Cargo.toml (should add)

### Positive Findings:

- ‚úÖ All 41 files analyzed thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Exceptional reusability matrix (100%, 80%, 95%, 64% per crate)
- ‚úÖ SSE refactoring plan for generics is solid
- ‚úÖ InferenceBackend trait enables all future workers
- ‚úÖ narration-core well-integrated (15√ó usage)
- ‚úÖ Risk-aware migration strategy

**Overall Score:** 97/100

## Key Lessons Learned

### What TEAM-131 Did Well:
1. Comprehensive file analysis
2. Clear crate boundary definitions
3. Concrete examples in shared crate audit
4. Good migration order (low ‚Üí high risk)

### What TEAM-131 Needs to Improve:
1. **Verify all shared crate usage** with grep (missed audit-logging)
2. **Provide evidence for claims** (test coverage)
3. **Consistent LOC counting** across documents
4. **Document integration points** more thoroughly

### What TEAM-133 Did Exceptionally:
1. **Perfect LOC verification** (5,026 exact match)
2. **Outstanding reusability analysis** (85% weighted)
3. **Generic design patterns** (InferenceEvent<T>, InferenceBackend)
4. **Detailed refactoring plans** for generics
5. **Proven pilot approach** (worker-rbee-error)

### What TEAM-133 Could Enhance:
1. Add missing shared crates (model-catalog, gpu-info)
2. Integrate unused shared crates (input-validation, secrets-management)
3. Document shared types with rbee-hive (hive-core?)

---

## Recommendations for Future Investigations

### Best Practices Identified:

1. ‚úÖ **Run cloc first** - Get exact LOC before making claims
2. ‚úÖ **grep every shared crate** - Don't assume usage patterns
3. ‚úÖ **Provide code evidence** - File paths, line numbers, command outputs
4. ‚úÖ **Verify test coverage** - Run actual coverage tools
5. ‚úÖ **Analyze reusability** - Critical for shared crate design
6. ‚úÖ **Design for generics** - Use traits and type parameters
7. ‚úÖ **Document integration points** - Critical for cross-team coordination
8. ‚úÖ **Prove claims with code** - Every claim needs evidence

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

1. ‚ùå **Assuming usage** - Always grep to verify
2. ‚ùå **Inconsistent LOC counts** - Use single source of truth
3. ‚ùå **Unverified claims** - "~60%" without proof is not acceptable
4. ‚ùå **Missing integration docs** - Document how binaries communicate
5. ‚ùå **Ignoring pilot learnings** - TEAM-130 proved decomposition works

## Cross-Team Questions Answered

### For TEAM-131 (from TEAM-132):

**Q:** Can we share types with rbee-hive?  
**A:** Yes - WorkerInfo, SpawnRequest/Response in hive-core

**Q:** How does rbee-hive notify queen-rbee when worker ready?  
**A:** Callback mechanism exists but not fully documented (found in source)

**Q:** Should narration-core be added?  
**A:** YES - rbee-hive currently doesn't use it but should for observability

### For TEAM-133 (from TEAM-132):

**Q:** Does llm-worker-rbee use hive-core?  
**A:** Not in Cargo.toml - should verify if shared types needed

**Q:** Should model-catalog be added?  
**A:** YES - Worker loads models and should query catalog for metadata

**Q:** Is InferenceBackend trait sufficient for all workers?  
**A:** YES - Excellent design, consider associated type for output
