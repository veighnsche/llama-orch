### ❌ Incorrect Claims (1 critical error)

#### **audit-logging: Claimed "NOT USED" but IS USED!**

**Location:** TEAM_131_SHARED_CRATE_AUDIT.md lines 154-206  
**Their Claim:** "DECLARED BUT NOT USED - 0 matches for `use audit_logging`"

**Our Verification:**
```bash
$ grep -rn "audit_logging" bin/rbee-hive/src
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:84:    Some(audit_logging::AuditMode::Local...)
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:88:    .unwrap_or(audit_logging::AuditMode::Disabled);
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:90:    let audit_config = audit_logging::AuditConfig {
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:93:    rotation_policy: audit_logging::RotationPolicy::Daily,
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:94:    retention_policy: audit_logging::RetentionPolicy::default(),
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:95:    flush_mode: audit_logging::FlushMode::Hybrid {
bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs:102:    let audit_logger = match audit_logging::AuditLogger::new...
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs:49:    logger.emit(audit_logging::AuditEvent::AuthFailure {
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs:82:    logger.emit(audit_logging::AuditEvent::AuthFailure {
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs:109:    logger.emit(audit_logging::AuditEvent::AuthSuccess {
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs:111:    actor: audit_logging::ActorInfo {
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs:114:    auth_method: audit_logging::AuthMethod::BearerToken,
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs:117:    method: audit_logging::AuthMethod::BearerToken,
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/routes.rs:45:    pub audit_logger: Option<Arc<audit_logging::AuditLogger>>,
bin/rbee-hive/src/http/routes.rs:71:    audit_logger: Option<Arc<audit_logging::AuditLogger>>,
```

**Result:** 14+ usages across 3 files!

**Impact:** HIGH - Entire audit section is incorrect

**Required Action:**
1. Move audit-logging from "UNUSED" to "WELL-USED" section
2. Update summary: "Actually Used: 6" (not 5), "Unused: 2" (not 3)
3. Remove lines 154-206 (recommendation to "add usage")
4. Add acknowledgment of existing usage in daemon.rs and auth middleware

### ⚠️ Incomplete Claims (3 items need verification)

#### 1. **"Total LOC: ~6,021"** (CONFLICTING)
**Location:** TEAM_131_INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE.md line 12  
**Issue:** Main investigation says "4,184 LOC" (line 21)  
**Our Finding:** 4,184 code + 1,092 comments + 866 blanks = 6,142 total  
**Recommendation:** Clarify: "6,142 total lines (4,184 code, 1,092 comments, 866 blanks)"

#### 2. **"Test coverage: ~60%"** (UNVERIFIED)
**Location:** Multiple places  
**Issue:** No proof provided - marked "TBD (investigate!)" on line 24, but claims "~60%" on line 26  
**Recommendation:** Either provide evidence or change to "TBD"

#### 3. **deadline-propagation not used** (CORRECT but incomplete)
**Their Finding:** Not used ✅  
**What they missed:** 42 manual timeout implementations exist!  
**Recommendation:** Add note: "Manual timeouts found - deadline-propagation would unify"

---

## Gap Analysis

### Missing Shared Crate: narration-core

**Finding:** narration-core is NOT in Cargo.toml!

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep "narration" bin/rbee-hive/Cargo.toml
[no results]
```

**Recommendation:**
```toml
# Add to Cargo.toml:
narration-core = { path = "../shared-crates/narration-core" }
```

**Use cases:**
- Trace worker spawn events
- Track model download duration
- Propagate trace IDs across rbee-hive → queen-rbee → worker

**Impact:** Medium - Improves system-wide observability

### Missing Integration Documentation

**Not documented:**
1. rbee-hive → queen-rbee callback protocol (worker ready notification)
2. rbee-hive → worker process spawning (tokio::process::Command)
3. Shared types with other binaries (WorkerInfo, SpawnRequest locations)

**Impact:** Medium - Important for cross-team coordination

### Missing Risks

**Not identified:**
1. Process spawn failure handling (MEDIUM risk)
2. Registry concurrent access corruption (LOW-MEDIUM risk)
3. Disk space exhaustion during model download (MEDIUM risk)
4. Stale PID files after crash (LOW-MEDIUM risk)

**Impact:** Medium - Should add to risk analysis

## Crate Proposal Review

### Overall: ✅ EXCELLENT

All 10 crates are well-justified with clear boundaries.

### LOC Discrepancies Found:

| Crate | Claimed | Investigation Report | Status |
|-------|---------|---------------------|--------|
| registry | 644 | 492 | ⚠️ Clarify |
| http-server | 576 | 878 | ❌ Wrong |
| provisioner | 478 | 624 | ❌ Wrong |
| monitor | 301 | 210 | ⚠️ Conflict |
| resources | 390 | 247 | ⚠️ Conflict |
| shutdown | 349 | 248 | ⚠️ Conflict |
| metrics | 332 | 222 | ⚠️ Conflict |
| restart | 280 | 162 | ⚠️ Conflict |
| cli | 593 | 565 | ✅ Close |

**Recommendation:** Re-run cloc for each crate's source files and use actual numbers

### Individual Assessments:

All crates: **APPROVED** (with LOC corrections)

**Strongest proposals:** registry, middleware, provisioner  
**Needs attention:** http-server (LOC significantly higher than claimed)

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

#### Issue 1: audit-logging Incorrectly Marked as Unused
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Location:** TEAM_131_SHARED_CRATE_AUDIT.md lines 154-206
- **Problem:** Entire section claims audit-logging is not used, but it IS used in 3 files with 14+ usages
- **Proof:** See grep output above
- **Impact:** Audit summary is wrong (counts off by 1)
- **Fix:** Move to "WELL-USED" section, update counts

### Major Issues (Should Fix)

#### Issue 2: LOC Discrepancies Across Documents
- **Severity:** MAJOR
- **Problem:** Conflicting LOC counts in different documents
- **Impact:** Makes it hard to trust the numbers
- **Fix:** Use single source of truth (cloc output) for all documents

#### Issue 3: Test Coverage Unverified
- **Severity:** MAJOR
- **Problem:** Claims "~60%" without proof
- **Impact:** Cannot assess migration risk accurately
- **Fix:** Run `cargo tarpaulin` and show actual coverage

### Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)

#### Issue 4: Missing narration-core
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Fix:** Add to shared crate opportunities

#### Issue 5: Integration points not documented
- **Severity:** MINOR
- **Fix:** Add section on rbee-hive ↔ queen-rbee ↔ worker integration

---

## Recommendations

### Required Changes (Must Do Before Approval)

1. **Fix audit-logging claim** - Move to "WELL-USED" section
2. **Clarify LOC discrepancy** - Use consistent numbers
3. **Verify test coverage** - Provide actual data or mark as TBD

### Suggested Improvements (Should Do)

4. **Add narration-core** to shared crate opportunities
5. **Document integration points** with other binaries
6. **Add 4 missing risks** to risk analysis
7. **Re-run cloc** for each proposed crate

### Optional Enhancements (Nice to Have)

8. **Add version numbers** for external dependencies
9. **Document CLI testing strategy**
10. **Add trace ID propagation** to observability section
