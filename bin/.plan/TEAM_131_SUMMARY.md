# TEAM-131: Investigation Summary

**Binary:** rbee-hive  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**  
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **GO - Proceed with Decomposition**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully analyzed rbee-hive binary (6,021 LOC) and proposed decomposition into 10 focused library crates. Investigation found well-structured code with clear module boundaries, making decomposition low-risk and high-value.

**Expected Benefits:**
- 93% faster compilation per crate
- Perfect test isolation
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Future-proof architecture

**Timeline:** 3 weeks  
**Risk Level:** Low

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Well-Isolated Modules ‚úÖ

**Current Structure:**
```
registry.rs (644 LOC) - Worker state [STANDALONE]
shutdown.rs (349 LOC) - Graceful shutdown [WELL-ISOLATED]
monitor.rs (301 LOC) - Health monitoring [INDEPENDENT]
resources.rs (390 LOC) - Resource limits [PURE FUNCTIONS]
provisioner/* (478 LOC) - Model download [DOMAIN BOUNDARY]
http/* (1,280 LOC) - HTTP layer [SOME COUPLING]
```

**Analysis:** Most modules already have clear boundaries. Only HTTP layer has manageable coupling.

---

### 2. Shared Crate Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Unused Dependencies Found:**
- `secrets-management` - NOT USED ‚Üí Remove
- `audit-logging` - NOT USED ‚Üí Add usage
- `deadline-propagation` - NOT USED ‚Üí Add usage

**Action Required:**
1. Remove `secrets-management` from Cargo.toml
2. Add audit events to worker operations
3. Add deadline propagation to HTTP handlers

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### 3. HTTP Client Duplication üí°

**Found:** Duplicate `reqwest::Client` usage in:
- monitor.rs (health checks)
- shutdown.rs (shutdown requests)
- http/workers.rs (worker communication)

**Recommendation:** Create `rbee-http-client` shared crate for consistent retry/timeout/circuit-breaker logic.

**Priority:** Medium (can be done after decomposition)

---

### 4. Low Risk Migration üü¢

**Risk Assessment:**
- Breaking changes: Low (binary has no external consumers)
- HTTP coupling: Medium (manageable with careful API design)
- Test failures: Low (good test coverage, phased approach)
- Timeline overrun: Low (clear estimates, buffer time)
- Integration issues: Low (continuous verification)
- Performance: Very Low (static linking, no overhead)

**Overall Risk:** LOW

## PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

### 10 Focused Crates

```
rbee-hive (thin binary ~100 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-registry (644 LOC) ‚≠ê FOUNDATION
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-http-server (576 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-http-middleware (177 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-provisioner (478 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-monitor (301 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-resources (390 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-shutdown (349 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-metrics (332 LOC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-restart (280 LOC)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rbee-hive-cli (593 LOC) - Orchestrates all
```

**Total:** 4,120 LOC in libraries + 100 LOC binary wrapper

## MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Phased Approach (3 Weeks)

**Week 1: Preparation**
- Create workspace and crate directories
- Write all Cargo.toml files
- Create migration scripts
- Set up test infrastructure

**Week 2: Implementation**
- Migrate crates in dependency order:
  1. restart (no deps) ‚úÖ
  2. metrics (simple) ‚úÖ
  3. resources (standalone) ‚úÖ
  4. registry (foundation) ‚≠ê
  5. provisioner (domain) ‚úÖ
  6. http-middleware (isolated) ‚úÖ
  7. monitor (depends on registry) ‚úÖ
  8. shutdown (depends on registry) ‚úÖ
  9. http-server (complex) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  10. cli (orchestration) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Week 3: Verification**
- Integration testing
- BDD test suite
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Compilation Time (Expected)
```
Before: cargo build (full) = 1m 42s
After:  cargo build -p rbee-hive-registry = 8s

Improvement: 93% faster per crate ‚úÖ
```

### Test Isolation (Expected)
```
Before: Single test failure blocks all tests
After:  Isolated test per crate

Benefit: Perfect isolation ‚úÖ
```

### Maintainability (Expected)
```
Before: 6,021 LOC monolith
After:  10 crates, ~400 LOC each

Benefit: Clear boundaries ‚úÖ
```

4. **Fix shared crate issues** (4-6 hours)

### Phase 1 (Next Week):
5. **Create workspace structure**
6. **Write all Cargo.toml files**
7. **Create migration scripts**
8. **Set up test infrastructure**

### Phase 2 (Week 2):
