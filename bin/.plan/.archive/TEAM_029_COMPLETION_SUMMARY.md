# TEAM-029 Completion Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-10T00:08:00+02:00  
**Team:** TEAM-029  
**Status:** ✅ Critical fixes complete, ⚠️ E2E blocked on model file

---

## Mission

Continue TEAM-028's work (who disconnected) to complete the MVP e2e test.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Fixed SQLite Database Connection (CRITICAL) ✅

**Problem:** Database file couldn't be created - error code 14  
**Root Cause:** SQLx requires specific connection string format

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `connection_string()` helper method
- Automatically adds `sqlite://` prefix
- Adds `?mode=rwc` parameter (read-write-create)
- Creates parent directory if missing

**Impact:** Phase 1 (Worker Registry) now works ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `bin/shared-crates/worker-registry/src/lib.rs` (+15 lines)

### 2. Fixed Localhost DNS Resolution ✅

**Problem:** `--node localhost` tried to connect to `localhost.home.arpa` (DNS error)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Special case for localhost and 127.0.0.1
- Don't append `.home.arpa` suffix for local testing

**Impact:** Phase 2 (Pool Preflight) now works for localhost ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `bin/rbee-keeper/src/commands/infer.rs` (+6 lines)

### 3. Improved Phase 7 Fail-Fast Logic (CRITICAL) ✅

**Problem:** Waited 5 minutes even when worker was completely unreachable

**Solution Implemented:**
- Track consecutive connection failures
- Fail after 10 consecutive errors (~20 seconds)
- Provide helpful error messages:
  - "worker binary may not be running"
  - "worker may have failed to start"

**Impact:** Tests fail fast instead of hanging for 5 minutes ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `bin/rbee-keeper/src/commands/infer.rs` (+30 lines)

### 4. Created Preflight Check Script ✅

**Created:** `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-preflight.sh`

**Checks:**
- Rust toolchain
- Binary builds (rbee-hive, rbee-keeper, llm-worker-rbee)
- Model file existence
- Port availability
- SQLite installation

**Impact:** Clear visibility into what's blocking e2e test ✅

### 5. Created Local E2E Test Script ✅

**Created:** `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-local.sh`

**Features:**
- Runs on localhost (no SSH required)
- Better error handling
- Shows daemon logs on failure
- Automatic cleanup

**Impact:** Easier to test locally without distributed setup ✅

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
```
✅ cargo test -p worker-registry
   1 passed, 1 ignored (SQLite in-memory issue)
```

### Build Tests
```
✅ cargo build --bin rbee-hive
✅ cargo build --bin rbee
✅ cargo build -p worker-registry
```

### Preflight Check
```
✅ Rust toolchain
✅ rbee-hive builds
✅ rbee-keeper builds
✅ llm-worker-rbee binary exists
❌ Model file not found
✅ Port 8080 available
✅ SQLite installed
```

### E2E Test Progress
```
[Phase 1] ✅ Worker registry check
[Phase 2] ✅ Pool preflight
[Phase 3-5] ✅ Worker spawn request
[Phase 6] ✅ Worker registration
[Phase 7] ❌ Worker ready (fails fast - no model)
[Phase 8] ⏸️ Not reached
```

## Metrics

**Time Spent:** ~30 minutes  
**Lines of Code Added:** ~200 lines  
**Lines of Code Modified:** ~50 lines  
**Files Created:** 3  
**Files Modified:** 2  
**Bugs Fixed:** 3 critical bugs  
**Tests Added:** 0 (existing tests still pass)

---

## What's Working Now

1. ✅ **SQLite database creation** - Workers can be registered
2. ✅ **Localhost testing** - No need for .home.arpa DNS
3. ✅ **Fast failure detection** - 20 seconds instead of 5 minutes
4. ✅ **Preflight validation** - Know what's missing before running
5. ✅ **Phases 1-6** - All orchestration logic works

---

## What's Blocked

### Blocker: No Model File

**Current State:**
- Worker binary exists ✅
- Worker can be spawned ✅
- Worker fails to start (no model file) ❌
- Phase 7 fails after 20 seconds ❌

**Paths Checked:**
- `/models/model.gguf`
- `~/.cache/llama-orch/models/tinyllama.gguf`
- `./models/tinyllama.gguf`

**Solutions:**
1. Run `bin/llm-worker-rbee/download_test_model.sh`
2. Copy existing model to one of the paths above
3. Update hardcoded path in `infer.rs:74`

---

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Hardcoded Model Path
**File:** `bin/rbee-keeper/src/commands/infer.rs:74`  
**Code:** `model_path: "/models/model.gguf".to_string()`  
**Impact:** Won't work if model is elsewhere  
**Priority:** Medium (has TODO comment)

### Issue 2: Hardcoded Backend
**File:** `bin/rbee-keeper/src/commands/infer.rs:72`  
**Code:** `backend: "cpu".to_string()`  
**Impact:** Can't use GPU  
**Priority:** Low (CPU works for testing)

### Issue 3: No Worker Cleanup on Failure
**Impact:** Worker processes may leak if test fails  
**Priority:** Medium (manual cleanup needed)

---

## Code Quality

### Followed dev-bee-rules.md ✅
- ✅ Added TEAM-029 signatures to all changes
- ✅ No background jobs in test scripts
- ✅ Blocking output only (no detached processes)
- ✅ Updated existing files instead of creating duplicates

### Error Handling ✅
- ✅ Proper Result<T, E> types
- ✅ Helpful error messages with context
- ✅ No unwrap() in production code

### Testing ✅
- ✅ Existing tests still pass
- ✅ Preflight script validates prerequisites
- ✅ Manual testing documented

---

## Recommendations for TEAM-030

### Immediate Actions

1. **Get model file** (BLOCKING)
   ```bash
   cd bin/llm-worker-rbee
   ./download_test_model.sh
   ```

2. **Run preflight check**
   ```bash
   ./bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-preflight.sh
   ```

3. **Run e2e test**
   ```bash
   ./bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-local.sh
   ```

### Future Work

1. **Model catalog integration** - Remove hardcoded paths
2. **Backend auto-detection** - Use GPU if available
3. **Worker lifecycle management** - Proper cleanup
4. **Integration tests** - Automated e2e testing
5. **Mock worker** - Test orchestration without real inference

## Final Notes

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ Quickly identified root causes (SQLite connection, DNS, fail-fast)
- ✅ All fixes were minimal and targeted
- ✅ Created helpful tooling (preflight check)
- ✅ Phases 1-6 now work reliably

**What Was Challenging:**
- 😓 SQLx connection string format not obvious
- 😓 TEAM-028 disconnected mid-work
- 😓 No model file available for testing

**Key Achievement:**
Transformed a 5-minute timeout into a 20-second fail-fast with clear error messages. The infrastructure is now solid and ready for real e2e testing once the model file is available.
