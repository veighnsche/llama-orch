# TEAM-274 Handoff: Worker Operations Implementation

**Date:** Oct 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Operations Implemented:** 6 of 28 (21%)

---

## üìã Mission

Implement high-priority worker operations from TEAM-272 checklist:
- Worker binary operations (catalog-based)
- Worker process operations (ps-based)
- CLI commands for new architecture

**Note:** Advanced scheduler deferred per user request ("take it easy on the scheduler").

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

### Phase 1: Worker Binary Operations (3 operations)

**Files Created:**
- None (used existing `rbee-hive-worker-catalog`)

**Files Modified:**
1. `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs` (+112 LOC)
   - WorkerBinaryList - List worker binaries from catalog
   - WorkerBinaryGet - Get worker binary details
   - WorkerBinaryDelete - Delete worker binary from catalog
   
2. `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/http/jobs.rs` (+4 LOC)
   - Added worker_catalog to HiveState
   - Updated From impl for JobState conversion

3. `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs` (+10 LOC)
   - Initialize WorkerCatalog
   - Add worker_catalog to job_state

4. `bin/20_rbee_hive/Cargo.toml` (+3 LOC)
   - Added rbee-hive-worker-catalog dependency

### Phase 2: Worker Process Operations (3 operations)

**Files Created:**
1. `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/process_list.rs` (130 LOC)
   - `list_worker_processes()` - Uses `ps aux` to find workers
   - Returns Vec<WorkerProcessInfo> (PID, command, memory, CPU, elapsed)

2. `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/process_get.rs` (130 LOC)
   - `get_worker_process()` - Uses `ps -p PID` to get process details
   - Returns WorkerProcessInfo for specific PID

**Files Modified:**
1. `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` (+13 LOC)
   - Added process_list and process_get modules
   - Re-exported WorkerProcessInfo type
   - Added architecture documentation (local ps vs registry tracking)

2. `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs` (+85 LOC)
   - WorkerProcessList - List worker processes using local ps
   - WorkerProcessGet - Get worker process details by PID
   - WorkerProcessDelete - Kill worker process (delegates to delete_worker)

### Phase 3: CLI Commands

**Files Modified:**
1. `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/main.rs` (+78 LOC)
   - Updated WorkerAction enum with nested subcommands
   - Added WorkerBinaryAction enum (List, Get, Delete)
   - Added WorkerProcessAction enum (List, Get, Delete)
   - Updated handle_command to route new operations

**New CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Worker binary operations
./rbee worker binary list --hive localhost
./rbee worker binary get <worker-type> --hive localhost
./rbee worker binary delete <worker-type> --hive localhost

# Worker process operations
./rbee worker process list --hive localhost
./rbee worker process get <pid> --hive localhost
./rbee worker process delete <pid> --hive localhost
```

## üìä Operations Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (6 operations)

**Hive Operations:**
1. ‚úÖ **WorkerBinaryList** - List worker binaries (catalog-based)
2. ‚úÖ **WorkerBinaryGet** - Get worker binary details
3. ‚úÖ **WorkerBinaryDelete** - Delete worker binary
4. ‚úÖ **WorkerProcessList** - List worker processes (ps-based)
5. ‚úÖ **WorkerProcessGet** - Get worker process details
6. ‚úÖ **WorkerProcessDelete** - Kill worker process

**Already Complete (from TEAM-272):**
- WorkerSpawn (TEAM-272)
- ModelList (TEAM-268)
- ModelGet (TEAM-268)
- ModelDelete (TEAM-268)
- Status (TEAM-190)

---

## üöß NOT IMPLEMENTED (22 operations remaining)

### High Priority (6 operations)
- [ ] WorkerDownload (8-12h) - Download worker binary from releases
- [ ] ModelDownload (16-24h) - Download model from HuggingFace
- [ ] ActiveWorkerList (12-16h) - List active workers from queen's registry
- [ ] ActiveWorkerGet (6-8h) - Get active worker details
- [ ] WorkerBuild (12-16h) - Build worker binary on hive

### Medium Priority (3 operations)
- [ ] ActiveWorkerRetire (8-12h) - Retire active worker

### Critical (1 operation)
- [ ] Infer (40-60h) - **DEFERRED per user request** - Advanced scheduler needed

### Low Priority (12 operations)
- [ ] WorkerBinaryDownload stubs (need download infrastructure)
- [ ] ActiveWorker operations (need worker registry in queen)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

### Worker Operation Taxonomy

**1. Worker Binary Operations (catalog on hive)**
- Manage worker binaries stored in `~/.cache/rbee/workers/`
- Stateless catalog operations
- Implemented: List, Get, Delete
- Not implemented: Download, Build (need download infrastructure)

**2. Worker Process Operations (local ps on hive)**
- Query running worker processes using `ps` commands
- Hive is STATELESS - just scans local processes
- Implemented: List, Get, Delete
- Uses WorkerProcessInfo struct (PID, command, memory, CPU, elapsed)

**3. Active Worker Operations (queen's heartbeat registry)**
- Track workers sending heartbeats to queen
- Queen is STATEFUL - maintains registry
- Not implemented: List, Get, Retire (need worker registry in queen)

### Key Differences

```
WorkerProcessList (TEAM-274):
- Hive-local operation
- Uses `ps aux | grep worker`
- Returns current process state
- No heartbeat required

ActiveWorkerList (future):
- Queen operation
- Queries heartbeat registry
- Returns tracked workers
- Requires workers to send heartbeats
```

## üîë Key Implementation Patterns

### 1. Worker Catalog Integration

```rust
// Hive main.rs initialization
let worker_catalog = Arc::new(
    WorkerCatalog::new().expect("Failed to initialize worker catalog")
);

// JobState includes worker_catalog
pub struct JobState {
    pub registry: Arc<JobRegistry<String>>,
    pub model_catalog: Arc<ModelCatalog>,
    pub worker_catalog: Arc<WorkerCatalog>, // TEAM-274
}
```

### 2. Process Operations Pattern

```rust
// Uses local ps command
let processes = list_worker_processes(&job_id).await?;

// Process info structure
pub struct WorkerProcessInfo {
    pub pid: u32,
    pub command: String,
    pub memory_kb: u64,
    pub cpu_percent: f32,
    pub elapsed: String,
}
```

### 3. CLI Nested Subcommands

```rust
#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum WorkerAction {
    Spawn { ... },
    Binary(WorkerBinaryAction),   // Nested
    Process(WorkerProcessAction),  // Nested
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum WorkerBinaryAction {
    List,
    Get { worker_type: String },
    Delete { worker_type: String },
}
```

## üéØ Next Team Priorities

### Immediate (TEAM-275)
1. **ActiveWorkerList/Get/Retire** (26-36h)
   - Create worker-registry crate in queen
   - Implement heartbeat tracking
   - Add list_active(), get(), retire() methods
   - Wire into queen job_router

2. **WorkerDownload** (8-12h)
   - Add download functionality to worker-catalog
   - Support GitHub releases or build artifacts
   - Stream download progress via SSE

### Medium Term
3. **ModelDownload** (16-24h)
   - Implement model provisioner
   - HuggingFace API integration
   - Resume on failure
   - Validation after download

### Long Term
4. **Infer** (40-60h) - **Complex scheduler needed**
   - Worker selection algorithm
   - Load balancing
   - Direct HTTP to workers
   - Token streaming
   - Failure handling

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Platform Support:** Process operations are Unix-only (uses nix crate)
2. **Worker Detection:** process_list uses heuristic grep for "worker" or "llm"
3. **No Worker Download:** Infrastructure not yet implemented
4. **No Active Worker Tracking:** Queen's worker registry not yet implemented
5. **No Inference Scheduling:** Deferred per user request

---

## üîç Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Start hive
cargo build --bin rbee-hive
./target/debug/rbee-hive

# 2. List worker binaries (should be empty initially)
cargo build --bin rbee-keeper
./target/debug/rbee-keeper worker binary list --hive localhost

# 3. List worker processes (should show any running workers)
./target/debug/rbee-keeper worker process list --hive localhost

# 4. Spawn a worker (from TEAM-272)
./target/debug/rbee-keeper worker spawn --model test-model --device cpu --hive localhost

# 5. List processes again (should show spawned worker)
./target/debug/rbee-keeper worker process list --hive localhost

# 6. Get process details by PID
./target/debug/rbee-keeper worker process get <pid> --hive localhost

# 7. Delete process
./target/debug/rbee-keeper worker process delete <pid> --hive localhost
```

### Unit Tests
- process_list.rs: test_list_worker_processes (smoke test)
- process_get.rs: test_get_current_process, test_get_nonexistent_process
- delete.rs: test_kill_nonexistent_process (already exists from TEAM-272)
