# Phase 5: Integration Flow Discovery - COMPLETE

**Date:** Oct 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL TEAMS COMPLETE  
**Duration:** 1 day (concurrent work)

---

## Executive Summary

All 4 teams completed integration flow discovery for cross-component interactions. Documented both IMPLEMENTED flows (hive operations) and INTENDED flows (worker/inference operations).

**Deliverables:** 4 integration flow documents (max 4 pages each)

---

## Team Completion Status

### ✅ TEAM-239: Keeper ↔ Queen (COMPLETE)
**Components:** `rbee-keeper` ↔ `queen-rbee`  
**Complexity:** High  
**Output:** `.plan/TEAM_239_KEEPER_QUEEN_INTEGRATION.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Dual-call pattern (POST creates job, GET streams results)
- Layered timeouts (HTTP 10s, SSE 30s, operation 15s, queen startup 30s)
- SSE channel lifecycle (create → execute → stream → cleanup)
- job_id propagation critical for SSE routing
- Queen stays alive policy (no auto-shutdown)

**Implemented Flows:**
- ✅ HiveList, HiveStart, HiveStop, HiveGet, HiveStatus
- ✅ SSE streaming with narration
- ✅ Error propagation (HTTP → SSE → CLI)

**Test Gaps:**
- ❌ Queen unreachable (auto-start)
- ❌ SSE stream closes early
- ❌ Multiple clients same job_id
- ❌ Network failures
- ❌ All timeout scenarios

---

### ✅ TEAM-240: Queen ↔ Hive (COMPLETE)
**Components:** `queen-rbee` ↔ `rbee-hive`  
**Complexity:** High  
**Output:** `.plan/TEAM_240_QUEEN_HIVE_INTEGRATION.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Hive spawn with Stdio::null() (prevents pipe hangs)
- Heartbeat system (5s interval, 30s staleness threshold)
- Capabilities discovery (GPU detection + caching)
- SSH integration (test connection, remote start planned)
- Worker state aggregation (hive → queen)

**Implemented Flows:**
- ✅ Hive spawn, health polling, capabilities fetch
- ✅ Heartbeat flow (hive → queen every 5s)
- ✅ SSH test connection

**Test Gaps:**
- ❌ SSH connection (success/failure)
- ❌ Remote hive start
- ❌ Heartbeat retry on failure
- ❌ Staleness detection
- ❌ Capabilities timeout
- ❌ Worker status aggregation

---

### ✅ TEAM-241: Hive ↔ Worker (COMPLETE - DOCUMENTED)
**Components:** `rbee-hive` ↔ `llm-worker-rbee`  
**Complexity:** High  
**Output:** `.plan/TEAM_241_HIVE_WORKER_INTEGRATION.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Worker lifecycle (spawn, register, heartbeat, shutdown)
- Model provisioning (discovery, download, validation, loading)
- Inference coordination (routing, streaming, slot management)
- Resource management (GPU assignment, VRAM tracking)
- Heartbeat infrastructure exists (30s interval, 60s staleness)

**Status:**
- ✅ Heartbeat infrastructure (shared crate)
- ✅ Worker state provider pattern
- ❌ Worker spawn NOT implemented
- ❌ Model provisioning NOT implemented
- ❌ Inference coordination NOT implemented

**Test Gaps:**
- ❌ ALL (nothing implemented yet)

---

### ✅ TEAM-242: E2E Inference (COMPLETE - DOCUMENTED)
**Components:** Full system (keeper → queen → hive → worker)  
**Complexity:** Very High  
**Output:** `.plan/TEAM_242_E2E_INFERENCE_FLOWS.md`

**Key Findings:**
- 15-step end-to-end flow (keeper → queen → hive → worker → tokens)
- Narration flow through all layers (with job_id propagation)
- Token streaming (worker → hive → queen → keeper)
- Distributed state management (job, hive, worker, model)
- Timeout propagation issues (only keeper has timeout)

**Status:**
- ✅ Infrastructure exists (job-registry, SSE, narration)
- ✅ Operation enum includes Infer
- ❌ Worker spawn NOT implemented
- ❌ Model loading NOT implemented
- ❌ Inference execution NOT implemented
- ❌ Token streaming NOT implemented

**Test Gaps:**
- ❌ ALL (nothing implemented yet)

## Statistics

### Integration Flows
- **Total Flows:** 4 integration boundaries
- **Implemented:** 2 flows (keeper ↔ queen, queen ↔ hive)
- **Documented:** 2 flows (hive ↔ worker, e2e inference)
- **Total Pages:** ~16 pages (avg 4 pages per team)

### Key Patterns
- **Dual-call pattern:** POST creates job, GET streams results
- **SSE streaming:** Job-scoped channels with job_id routing
- **Narration flow:** All layers emit narration with job_id
- **Heartbeat system:** Three-tier (worker → hive → queen)
- **Timeout handling:** Layered timeouts at each boundary

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. job_id Propagation is CRITICAL

**Why:**
- SSE sink requires job_id for routing
- Without job_id, events are dropped (fail-fast security)
- Must propagate through all layers (queen → hive → worker)

**Enforcement:**
- All operation handlers receive job_id parameter
- All narration includes `.job_id(&job_id)`
- TimeoutEnforcer includes `.with_job_id(&job_id)`

### 2. Layered Timeouts

**Current:**
```text
Keeper: 30s (SSE streaming)
Queen: 15s (operation execution)
Hive: None
Worker: None
```

**Issue:** Only keeper and queen have timeouts

**Better:**
```text
Keeper: 30s
Queen: 25s
Hive: 20s
Worker: 15s
```

**Benefit:** Each layer times out before parent, clean error propagation

### 3. Cleanup on Disconnect

**Current:**
- Client disconnect → Queen/Hive/Worker keep running (orphaned)
- No cleanup signal propagates

**Better:**
- Detect disconnect at each layer
- Send cancel signal downstream
- Clean up resources

### 4. State Persistence

**Current:**
- All state in-memory (job registry, hive registry, worker registry)
- Queen restart → all jobs lost

**Better:**
- Persist job state to disk
- Reconnect to hives on restart
- Resume operations

### 5. Stdio::null() is MANDATORY

**Why:**
- Prevents pipe hangs when parent runs via Command::output()
- Critical for E2E tests

**Enforcement:**
- DaemonManager always sets Stdio::null()
- Documented in daemon-lifecycle crate

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 6: Test Planning
**Teams:** TEAM-250 to TEAM-254  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Focus:** Comprehensive test plans for all integration flows

**Test Categories:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Individual component behavior
2. **Integration Tests:** Cross-component interactions
3. **E2E Tests:** Full system flows
4. **Error Tests:** All error scenarios
5. **Performance Tests:** Timeout, concurrency, load

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Dual-call pattern** - Clean separation of job creation and execution
2. **SSE streaming** - Real-time feedback to users
3. **Narration system** - Consistent observability across all layers
4. **job_id propagation** - Enables job-scoped SSE routing
5. **Shared crates** - Heartbeat, job-registry, timeout-enforcer

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Timeout propagation** - Only keeper has timeout, server keeps running
2. **Cleanup on disconnect** - No signal to downstream components
3. **State persistence** - All state in-memory, lost on restart
4. **Error handling** - Some errors not propagated properly
5. **Test coverage** - Many flows untested

### Critical Patterns
1. **job_id MUST propagate** - Without it, narration doesn't reach SSE
2. **[DONE] marker MUST be sent** - Keeper uses it to detect completion
3. **Stdio::null() MUST be used** - Prevents pipe hangs in E2E tests
4. **Layered timeouts** - Each layer should timeout before parent
5. **Cleanup signals** - Disconnect should propagate downstream

**Status:** ✅ PHASE 5 COMPLETE  
**Ready for:** Phase 6 (Test Planning)  
**Total Time:** 1 day (concurrent work)  
**Total Output:** 4 integration flow documents (~16 pages)
