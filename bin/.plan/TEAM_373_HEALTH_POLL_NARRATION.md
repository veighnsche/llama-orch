# TEAM-373: Health Poll Narration Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Problem

After `rebuild_daemon()` successfully built and started the daemon, it would hang at the health check step with no visible progress updates. The user would see:

```
lifecycle_ssh::start::start_daemon health_check
🏥 Polling health endpoint: http://192.168.178.29:7835

[HANGS HERE - no further output]
```

### Root Cause

The `health_poll::poll_health()` function was using only `tracing::debug!()` and `tracing::info!()` for logging, which doesn't go through the narration system. The function would silently poll up to 30 times with exponential backoff, leaving the user with no feedback.

### Investigation

Manual testing confirmed the daemon was healthy:
```bash
$ curl http://192.168.178.29:7835/health
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  # ✅ Daemon responding correctly
```

The health check was working, but the user couldn't see the polling progress.

## Solution

Added narration to the `health-poll` crate to provide user-visible progress updates during health check polling.

### Changes Made

**File 1: `bin/96_lifecycle/health-poll/Cargo.toml`**
- Added `observability-narration-core` dependency
- Added `stdext` dependency (required by `n!()` macro)

**File 2: `bin/96_lifecycle/health-poll/src/lib.rs`**
- Added `use observability_narration_core::n;`
- Added narration for each polling attempt:
  - `n!("health_attempt", ...)` - Shows attempt number (1/30, 2/30, etc.)
  - `n!("health_success", ...)` - Shows when health check passes
  - `n!("health_retry", ...)` - Shows retry reason (HTTP error or connection failed)

### New User Experience

Now users see real-time progress during health checks:

```
lifecycle_ssh::start::start_daemon health_check
🏥 Polling health endpoint: http://192.168.178.29:7835
health_poll::poll_health health_attempt
⏳ Health check attempt 1/30
health_poll::poll_health health_success
✅ Health check passed
lifecycle_ssh::start::start_daemon healthy
✅ Daemon is healthy and responding
```

If the daemon is slow to start, users see:

```
⏳ Health check attempt 1/30
⏳ Connection failed - retrying...
⏳ Health check attempt 2/30
⏳ Connection failed - retrying...
⏳ Health check attempt 3/30
✅ Health check passed
```

## Files Changed

1. `bin/96_lifecycle/health-poll/Cargo.toml` (+2 dependencies)
2. `bin/96_lifecycle/health-poll/src/lib.rs` (+5 narration calls)

## Benefits

- ✅ **User visibility:** Users can see health check progress in real-time
- ✅ **No more silent hangs:** Clear feedback during exponential backoff
- ✅ **Debugging aid:** Users can see why health checks are failing (HTTP error vs connection refused)
- ✅ **Consistent UX:** Health polling now uses same narration system as rest of lifecycle operations

## Testing

```bash
# Rebuild will now show health check progress
cargo build --bin rbee-keeper
rbee-keeper hive rebuild workstation

# Expected output:
# 🔨 Building rbee-hive locally
# ✅ Built: target/debug/rbee-hive
# 🛑 Stopping running daemon
# ✅ Daemon stopped
# 📦 Installing new binary
# ✅ New binary installed
# 🚀 Starting daemon with new binary
# ✅ Daemon started with PID: 1146613
# 🏥 Polling health endpoint: http://192.168.178.29:7835
# ⏳ Health check attempt 1/30  ← NEW!
# ✅ Health check passed         ← NEW!
# ✅ Daemon is healthy and responding
# 🎉 rbee-hive rebuilt and restarted successfully
```
