## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES

### ‚ùå WRONG: "I'll read TEAM_130B_FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md for the plan"
**Problem:** That's reference material, not the execution plan!  
**‚úÖ RIGHT:** Read TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md for the actual plan

---

### ‚ùå WRONG: "I'll write one 60-page file per binary"
**Problem:** Token limits! Plus that's outdated structure  
**‚úÖ RIGHT:** Write 3 separate files per binary (PART1, PART2, PART3)

---

### ‚ùå WRONG: "I'll skip Phase 1 and start writing"
**Problem:** You'll miss cross-binary opportunities!  
**‚úÖ RIGHT:** Complete Phase 1 fully, build complete mental model

---

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Each team can work independently"
**Problem:** Need shared understanding for cross-binary analysis  
**‚úÖ RIGHT:** Collaborate in Phase 1, can split work in Phase 2 & 3
