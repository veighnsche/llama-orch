# TEAM-130B: FINAL INVESTIGATION SYNTHESIS

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This document contains detailed methodology and reference material.**

**üëâ PRIMARY GUIDE: See `TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md` for the actual 3-phase execution plan!**

**This document is now REFERENCE ONLY for:**
- Detailed synthesis methodology
- Deep-dive processes
- Background information

**For actual execution, use the PHASED APPROACH (9-12 days, 3 phases, 13 files).**

---

## üìñ REFERENCE: Synthesis Methodology

This section describes the detailed methodology for synthesizing investigations.

**Note:** The actual execution is split into 3 phases (see TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md):
- Phase 1: Read & cross-binary analysis (Days 1-4)
- Phase 2: rbee-hive + queen-rbee (Days 5-8)
- Phase 3: llm-worker + rbee-keeper (Days 9-12)

---

## üéØ MISSION (REFERENCE)

**Synthesize ALL investigations and peer reviews into definitive, actionable investigation files.**

**Your job is to:**
1. Read EVERY investigation report from Teams 131, 132, 133, 134
2. Read EVERY peer review (8 total)
3. Reconcile conflicting findings
4. Identify cross-binary shared crate opportunities
5. Suggest external Rust library improvements
6. Create FINAL, ACTIONABLE investigation files (13 files total)

**Focus:** CRATE DESIGN, not binary functionality  
**Output:** Actionable, ready-to-execute investigation files

**Note:** Each binary is split into 3 files (PART1_METRICS, PART2_LIBRARIES, PART3_MIGRATION) to avoid token limits.

## üîç REFERENCE: Detailed Synthesis Methodology

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This is reference material describing the synthesis process in detail.

**For actual execution timeline, see TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md which spreads this work over 9-12 days in 3 phases.**

---

### Data Collection (Reference)

**Reading ALL Investigations**

For each binary, extract:
1. Proposed crates (name, LOC, purpose, dependencies)
2. Shared crate usage claims
3. Architecture decisions
4. Open questions/TBD items
5. Risk assessments

**Afternoon: Read ALL Peer Reviews**

For each review, extract:
1. Claim corrections (wrong LOC counts, etc.)
2. Gaps found (missing files, dependencies, shared crates)
3. Answered questions
4. New shared crate opportunities
5. Recommendations

---

### Day 2: Reconciliation & Cross-Binary Analysis

**Morning: Reconcile Conflicts**

Process:
1. Compare original vs peer reviews
2. Identify discrepancies (LOC, architecture, dependencies)
3. Run your own verification (cloc, grep, cargo tree)
4. Determine ground truth
5. Document resolutions

**Afternoon: Cross-Binary Shared Crate Analysis**

üîç CRITICAL: Analyze shared crate usage ACROSS all 4 binaries!

For EACH shared crate (10+):
1. Check usage in rbee-hive
2. Check usage in queen-rbee
3. Check usage in llm-worker-rbee
4. Check usage in rbee-keeper
5. Identify patterns and gaps
6. Document cross-binary opportunities

---

### Day 3: External Library Research

**Morning: Audit Current Dependencies**

For each binary:
```bash
cd bin/[binary]
cargo tree --depth 1
cargo outdated
cargo audit
cargo tree --duplicates
```

**Afternoon: Research Better Libraries**

Focus areas:
1. **HTTP/Web** - axum, actix-web versions
2. **Async** - tokio features optimization
3. **CLI** - clap v4, indicatif, console, dialoguer
4. **Testing** - rstest, proptest, wiremock, tempfile
5. **SSH** - russh (replace manual Command)
6. **Observability** - tracing, metrics
7. **Error Handling** - anyhow, thiserror
8. **Configuration** - config, figment
9. **Secrets** - secrecy, keyring
10. **GPU/System** - sysinfo, nvml-wrapper

---

### Day 4: Write Final Investigation Files

Create 4 files:
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-hive_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_queen-rbee_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_llm-worker-rbee_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-keeper_INVESTIGATION.md`

See template below.

## Shared Crate Usage Analysis

### Currently Used

#### auth-min
- **Usage:** [describe]
- **Assessment:** FULL/PARTIAL/MINIMAL
- **Recommendations:** [list]

[Repeat for each]

### Missing Opportunities (CRITICAL!)

#### auth-min in queen-rbee
- **Gap:** Manual auth code instead of auth-min
- **Evidence:** src/http/middleware.rs:67
- **Migration:** ~150 LOC refactor
- **Priority:** CRITICAL

[Repeat for each gap]

### Cross-Binary Recommendations

#### Standardize Authentication
**Affected:**
- rbee-hive ‚úÖ (good)
- queen-rbee ‚ùå (needs migration)
- rbee-keeper ‚ö†Ô∏è (partial)
- llm-worker-rbee üîÆ (prepare)

**Actions:**
1. Refactor queen-rbee ‚Üí auth-min (~150 LOC, 3h)
2. Expand rbee-keeper ‚Üí auth-min (~50 LOC, 1h)
3. Add llm-worker-rbee dependency (prepare)

**Total Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

[Repeat for other cross-binary opportunities]

---

## External Rust Library Recommendations

### Add New

#### rstest (Testing)
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
rstest = "0.18"
```
**Why:** Parameterized tests  
**Effort:** 2-3h to refactor  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

[Repeat for 5+ libraries]

### Replace Existing

#### russh (Replace manual SSH)
**Current:** tokio::process::Command (vulnerable!)  
**New:** russh = "0.40"

**Why:**
- Fixes command injection vulnerability
- Pure Rust, async
- Type-safe

**Migration:** ~200 LOC  
**Priority:** HIGH (security)

[Repeat for others]

### Remove Unused

- [library]: In Cargo.toml, never imported
- Action: Remove

### Update Outdated

- [library] 0.3.0 ‚Üí 0.5.2
- Breaking changes: [list]
- Migration: [describe]

---

## Migration Strategy (Actionable)

### Phase 1: Skeletons (Day 1, 2-3h)
```bash
mkdir -p bin/[binary]-crates/[crate]/{src,tests}
# Create Cargo.toml, lib.rs stubs
```

### Phase 2: Move Code (Days 2-3, [X]h)

Order: [bottom-up based on deps]

**Step 1: [crate-1]**
```bash
git mv src/[file].rs ../[binary]-crates/[crate]/src/
# Update imports
# Validate: cargo test
```

[Repeat for each crate]

### Phase 3: Testing (Day 4, 4h)
```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Day 5, 2h)
- Remove old code
