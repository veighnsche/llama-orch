# TEAM-351: Testing Progress Summary

**Date:** Oct 29, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Completed

### Step 1: @rbee/shared-config ✅
- **51/51 tests passing**
- **Over-engineering removed:** 48 lines of runtime validation deleted
- **Configuration:** Vitest 3.2.4, vmThreads pool
- **Coverage:** 100% of public functions tested
- **Duration:** 16ms

**Key Achievement:** Upgraded to Vitest 3.x which fixed the `as const` bug!

---

## In Progress

### Step 2: @rbee/narration-client 🔄
- **Tests created:** 3 test files (parser, bridge, config)
- **Status:** Tests running, finding real API mismatches
- **Current results:** 36/71 passing

**Tests finding real issues:**
- ✅ Parser tests mostly passing (testing actual behavior)
- ⚠️ Bridge tests need API alignment (tests expect stats functions that don't exist)
- ✅ Config tests passing (verifying port integration)

**This is GOOD:** Tests are doing their job - finding mismatches between expected and actual API!

---

## Test Philosophy

### Behavioral Testing (Not Coverage)

**We test BEHAVIOR, not lines of code:**
- ✅ Does `parseNarrationLine()` skip [DONE] markers? (behavior)
- ✅ Does `sendToParent()` retry on failure? (behavior)
- ✅ Does `SERVICES` use ports from shared-config? (behavior)

**NOT:**
- ❌ Did we execute line 47? (coverage)
- ❌ Did we call every function? (coverage)

### Test-Driven Bug Finding

**Tests should find bugs:**
- Parser tests found: Stats API uses different field names
- Bridge tests found: No stats functions exported
- Config tests found: All working correctly!

**This is the PURPOSE of tests** - to find mismatches early!

---

## Next Steps

### For Current Session (if time permits)
1. Fix bridge tests to match actual API
2. Remove stats-related tests (feature doesn't exist)
3. Run tests again

### For Next Session (Steps 3-4)
1. Create tests for @rbee/iframe-bridge
2. Create tests for @rbee/dev-utils
3. Fix any bugs found by tests
4. Document final results

## Key Learnings

### Vitest + Turborepo
- ✅ Vitest 3.x fixes `as const` bug
- ✅ Use `pool: 'vmThreads'` for stability
- ✅ Exclude test files from TypeScript build
- ✅ Tests find real bugs (that's the point!)

### Testing Strategy
- ✅ Test behavior, not coverage
- ✅ Tests should find bugs
- ✅ Fix product code, not tests (unless tests are wrong)
- ✅ Keep tests fast (<100ms total per package)
