# Phase 6: Test Planning - COMPLETE

**Date:** Oct 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** 1 day

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 6 test planning is complete. After deep analysis of all Phase 4 and 5 behavior documents, I've created a comprehensive testing strategy with **reasonable, NUC-friendly scope** (5-10 concurrent operations, not 100+).

**Total Testing Gap:** ~585 tests (450 original + 135 additional)  
**Total Effort:** 177-248 days (1 developer) or 20-28 weeks (3 developers)

## Key Findings

### 1. Reasonable Scale Guidelines

**What's Reasonable for a NUC:**
- ‚úÖ 5-10 concurrent operations
- ‚úÖ 100 jobs/hives/workers
- ‚úÖ 1MB payloads
- ‚úÖ 5 workers per hive
- ‚úÖ 10 concurrent SSE channels

**What's Overkill:**
- ‚ùå 100+ concurrent operations
- ‚ùå 1000+ jobs/hives/workers
- ‚ùå 10MB+ payloads
- ‚ùå 50+ workers per hive
- ‚ùå 100+ concurrent SSE channels

### 2. Critical Gaps (Must Fix First)

1. **SSE Channel Lifecycle** - Memory leaks, race conditions (15-20 tests, 5-7 days)
2. **Concurrent Access** - Job-registry, hive-registry (20-30 tests, 7-10 days)
3. **Timeout Propagation** - Only keeper has timeout (15-20 tests, 5-7 days)
4. **Resource Cleanup** - No cleanup on disconnect (20-25 tests, 7-10 days)
5. **Error Propagation** - Some errors not propagated (25-30 tests, 7-10 days)
6. **Stdio::null()** - CRITICAL for E2E tests (5-10 tests, 2-3 days)
7. **job_id Propagation** - Without it, narration doesn't reach SSE (10-15 tests, 3-5 days)

### 3. Additional Specific Gaps

**SSH Client (TEAM-222):**
- 0% test coverage
- 15 tests needed (5-7 days)
- Pre-flight checks, TCP connection, handshake, auth, command exec

**Hive Lifecycle (TEAM-220):**
- ~10% test coverage
- 25 tests needed (10-15 days)
- Binary resolution, health polling, capabilities cache, graceful shutdown

**Hive Registry (TEAM-221):**
- ~5% test coverage
- 20 tests needed (7-10 days)
- Concurrent access (reasonable scale), staleness, worker aggregation

**Daemon Lifecycle (TEAM-231):**
- 0% test coverage
- 10 tests needed (3-5 days)
- **Stdio::null() CRITICAL** - prevents E2E test hangs

### 4. Test Coverage Goals

| Category | Current | Target | Gap |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Unit Tests | ~20% | 80%+ | 60% |
| Integration Tests | ~5% | 70%+ | 65% |
| E2E Tests | ~10% | 50%+ | 40% |
| Performance Tests | 0% | 100% | 100% |

## Critical Invariants (MUST Test)

1. **job_id MUST propagate** - Without it, narration doesn't reach SSE
2. **[DONE] marker MUST be sent** - Keeper uses it to detect completion
3. **Stdio::null() MUST be used** - Prevents pipe hangs in E2E tests
4. **Timeouts MUST fire** - Zero tolerance for hanging operations
5. **Channels MUST be cleaned up** - Prevent memory leaks

---

## Testing Principles

### Focus on IMPLEMENTED Features

‚úÖ **Test:** Hive operations (start, stop, status, list)  
‚úÖ **Test:** SSE streaming (narration, job-scoped channels)  
‚úÖ **Test:** Heartbeat flow (hive ‚Üí queen)

‚ùå **Don't Test:** Worker operations (NOT IMPLEMENTED)  
‚ùå **Don't Test:** Inference flow (NOT IMPLEMENTED)  
‚ùå **Don't Test:** Model provisioning (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Reasonable Scale (NUC-Friendly)

‚úÖ **DO:** 5-10 concurrent operations  
‚úÖ **DO:** 100 jobs/hives/workers  
‚úÖ **DO:** 1MB payloads  
‚úÖ **DO:** 5 workers per hive

‚ùå **DON'T:** 100+ concurrent operations  
‚ùå **DON'T:** 1000+ jobs/hives/workers  
‚ùå **DON'T:** 10MB+ payloads  
‚ùå **DON'T:** 50+ workers per hive
