# CORRECTION SUMMARY: Unimplemented Features vs Test Gaps

**Date:** Oct 22, 2025  
**Issue:** Teams confused unimplemented features with test coverage gaps  
**Resolution:** All planning documents corrected

---

## The Problem

Teams were documenting **unimplemented features** (future work) as **test coverage gaps** (missing tests for existing code).

### Examples of Confusion:

**TEAM-217 (queen-rbee):**
- ❌ Listed Worker/Model/Infer operations as "CRITICAL GAPS"
- ✅ These are **future features** (TODO markers, not implemented)

**TEAM-218 (rbee-hive):**
- ❌ Listed worker management, model management as "Critical Gaps (Blocks Production)"
- ✅ These are **future features** (stubs, intentional)

**TEAM-219 (llm-worker-rbee):**
- ❌ Listed heartbeat HTTP POST as "missing integration test"
- ✅ This is a **future feature** (TODO marker, not implemented)

---

## The Correction

### Clear Definitions

**Unimplemented Feature (NOT a test gap):**
- Code has TODO markers
- Endpoints documented but not in main.rs
- Operations defined but match arms are stubs
- Supporting crates are stubs
- **These are INTENTIONAL - future work, not bugs**

**Test Gap (NEEDS tests):**
- Code is IMPLEMENTED but has NO tests
- Behavior EXISTS but is NOT covered by unit/BDD/integration tests
- Error paths EXIST but are NOT tested
- Edge cases EXIST but are NOT tested

**The Goal: Test what we HAVE TODAY, not what we PLAN to build tomorrow.**

## Files Corrected

### Behavior Inventories
1. **TEAM_217_QUEEN_RBEE_BEHAVIORS.md**
   - Marked Worker/Model/Infer operations as "FUTURE FEATURES"
   - Removed from "CRITICAL GAPS" section
   - Updated implementation status to show 10/10 (100% of current scope)

2. **TEAM_218_RBEE_HIVE_BEHAVIORS.md**
   - Marked protected endpoints as "FUTURE FEATURES"
   - Separated test gaps (for implemented features) from future features
   - Clarified IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md is a design doc (roadmap)

3. **TEAM_219_LLM_WORKER_BEHAVIORS.md**
   - Marked heartbeat HTTP POST as "future feature"
   - Removed from integration test gaps
   - Clarified TODO markers are intentional

### Planning Documents
4. **BEHAVIOR_DISCOVERY_MASTER_PLAN.md**
   - Added "CRITICAL: Unimplemented Features vs Test Gaps" section
   - Clear definitions with examples
   - Emphasized focus on testing what EXISTS

5. **PHASE_1_START_HERE.md**
   - Added "CRITICAL: Test What EXISTS Today" section
   - Clear DON'T: "Confuse unimplemented features with test gaps"

6. **PHASE_2_GUIDES.md**
   - Added "CRITICAL: Test Gaps vs Future Features" to success criteria

7. **PHASE_3_GUIDES.md**
   - Added note about many hive crates being STUBS (intentional)
   - Emphasized focus on testing what EXISTS (e.g., device-detection)

8. **PHASE_4_GUIDES.md**
   - Added "CRITICAL: Test Gaps vs Future Features" to deliverables

9. **PHASE_5_GUIDES.md**
   - Added list of unimplemented integration flows
   - Emphasized focus on testing IMPLEMENTED flows

## Current Implementation Status

### What EXISTS Today (Needs Tests)

**rbee-keeper (TEAM-216):**
- ✅ All CLI commands implemented
- ✅ HTTP client with SSE streaming
- ✅ Queen lifecycle management
- **Test gaps:** CLI commands, error paths, edge cases

**queen-rbee (TEAM-217):**
- ✅ 10/10 operations implemented:
  - Status operation
  - 9 hive operations (SshTest, Install, Uninstall, Start, Stop, List, Get, Status, RefreshCapabilities)
  - Heartbeat receiver
  - SSE streaming
- **Test gaps:** HTTP endpoints, job execution, SSE streaming, operation routing

**rbee-hive (TEAM-218):**
- ✅ 2/2 endpoints implemented:
  - GET /health
  - GET /capabilities (device detection)
- ✅ Heartbeat sender to queen
- **Test gaps:** Daemon lifecycle, device detection, heartbeat

**llm-worker-rbee (TEAM-219):**
- ✅ Full inference pipeline implemented
- ✅ Model loading (4 architectures, 2 formats)
- ✅ Token streaming (dual-call pattern)
- ✅ Authentication (network vs local mode)
- **Test gaps:** Dual-call pattern, SSE streaming, generation engine, KV cache reset

### What's PLANNED (Future Features)

**queen-rbee:**
- ⏳ Worker operations (4): spawn, list, get, delete
- ⏳ Model operations (4): download, list, get, delete
- ⏳ Inference operation (1)

**rbee-hive:**
- ⏳ Worker management endpoints (3)
- ⏳ Model management endpoints (3)
- ⏳ Worker heartbeat receiver
- ⏳ VRAM capacity checking
- ⏳ Graceful shutdown

**llm-worker-rbee:**
- ⏳ Heartbeat HTTP POST to hive

**Supporting Crates (Hive):**
- ⏳ download-tracker
- ⏳ model-catalog
- ⏳ model-provisioner
- ⏳ monitor
- ⏳ vram-checker
- ⏳ worker-catalog
- ⏳ worker-lifecycle
- ⏳ worker-registry

## Impact

### Before Correction
- Teams would create test plans for **unimplemented features**
- Wasted effort testing code that doesn't exist
- Confusion about what's a bug vs what's future work

### After Correction
- Teams focus on testing **implemented features**
- Clear separation: test gaps vs future features
- Efficient test planning for current scope

---

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 6 (Test Planning):** Use corrected inventories to create test plans
2. **Focus:** Test the 10 implemented operations in queen-rbee, 2 endpoints in rbee-hive, full pipeline in llm-worker-rbee
3. **Ignore:** Future features until they're implemented

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**All documents corrected:** 9 files updated  
**Ready for:** Phase 6 test planning with correct scope
