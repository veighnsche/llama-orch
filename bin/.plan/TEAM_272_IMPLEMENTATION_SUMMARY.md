# TEAM-272: Worker Lifecycle Management - Implementation Summary

**Date:** Oct 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Total Time:** ~3 hours

---

## üéØ Mission

Implement worker lifecycle management operations following the **CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE** from `CORRECTION_269_TO_272_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md`.

**Key Principle:** Hive is STATELESS - workers are tracked by queen via heartbeats.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Worker Deletion Module

**File:** `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/delete.rs` (151 LOC)

**Function:** `delete_worker(job_id: &str, worker_id: &str, pid: u32) -> Result<()>`

**Features:**
- Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM ‚Üí wait 2s ‚Üí SIGKILL if needed)
- Platform-specific (Unix: full support, Windows: not implemented)
- Full narration support with job_id routing
- Doesn't fail if process already dead

### 2. Worker Spawn Integration

**File:** `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs`

**Operation:** `WorkerSpawn` - Fully implemented using `rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::spawn_worker()`

**Features:**
- Port allocation (random for now)
- Queen URL configuration (hardcoded for now)
- Full narration with job_id routing
- Returns PID and port

### 3. Worker List/Get Operations

**Operations:** `WorkerList`, `WorkerGet`

**Implementation:** Redirect to queen with explanatory narration

**Rationale:** Hive is stateless - workers send heartbeats to queen, not hive

### 4. Worker Delete Operation

**Operation:** `WorkerDelete`

**Implementation:** Explains architecture, returns error requesting PID from queen

**Future:** Once queen provides PID, will call `delete_worker()`

## üìä Files Changed

### Created
- `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/delete.rs` (151 LOC)
- `bin/.plan/TEAM_272_HANDOFF.md` (comprehensive handoff document)
- `bin/.plan/TEAM_272_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified
- `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/src/lib.rs` (added delete module, architectural notes)
- `bin/25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle/Cargo.toml` (added nix dependency)
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs` (wired up all 4 worker operations)
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/Cargo.toml` (added worker-lifecycle and rand dependencies)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Alignment

### Corrected Architecture

```
QUEEN (Orchestrator)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Tracks workers via heartbeats
  ‚îú‚îÄ Routes inference requests
  ‚îî‚îÄ Worker registry (source of truth)
       ‚îÇ
       ‚îÇ HTTP (operations)
       ‚Üì
HIVE (Stateless Executor)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Executes WorkerSpawn
  ‚îú‚îÄ Executes WorkerDelete (with PID from queen)
  ‚îú‚îÄ NO worker tracking
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO WorkerList/WorkerGet (query queen instead)
       ‚îÇ
       ‚îÇ Process spawn
       ‚Üì
WORKER (Inference Engine)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Sends heartbeat to QUEEN
  ‚îî‚îÄ Serves inference requests
```

**‚úÖ Implementation follows this architecture exactly.**

## üìù Code Statistics

**worker-lifecycle crate:**
- Total: ~489 LOC
  - spawn.rs: 230 LOC (TEAM-271)
  - delete.rs: 151 LOC (TEAM-272)
  - types.rs: 41 LOC (TEAM-271)
  - lib.rs: 67 LOC (updated)

**job_router.rs changes:**
- WorkerSpawn: ~45 LOC (implemented)
- WorkerList: ~20 LOC (redirect to queen)
- WorkerGet: ~18 LOC (redirect to queen)
- WorkerDelete: ~30 LOC (needs PID from queen)
- Total: ~113 LOC

---

## üß™ Testing

### Compilation
```bash
cargo check --package rbee-hive-worker-lifecycle
# ‚úÖ PASS

cargo check --bin rbee-hive
# ‚úÖ PASS (with warnings about unused constants - expected)
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
cargo test --package rbee-hive-worker-lifecycle
# ‚úÖ 2 tests passing (1 from TEAM-271, 1 from TEAM-272)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### 1. WorkerList/WorkerGet Not in Hive
**Status:** By design (hive is stateless)  
**Future:** Implement in queen-rbee

### 2. WorkerDelete Needs PID
**Status:** Waiting for queen integration  
**Future:** Queen provides PID when calling WorkerDelete

### 3. Port Allocation is Random
**Status:** Simple implementation  
**Future:** Implement proper port pool

### 4. Queen URL Hardcoded
**Status:** Hardcoded to `http://localhost:8500`  
**Future:** Get from config

### 5. Windows Not Supported
**Status:** Process killing only works on Unix  
**Future:** Implement Windows support

---

## üîó Dependencies Added

### worker-lifecycle/Cargo.toml
```toml
[target.'cfg(unix)'.dependencies]
nix = { version = "0.27", features = ["signal"] }
```

### rbee-hive/Cargo.toml
```toml
rbee-hive-worker-lifecycle = { path = "../25_rbee_hive_crates/worker-lifecycle" }
rand = "0.8"
```

---

## üìö Key Design Decisions

### 1. Hive is Stateless
**Decision:** Hive does NOT track workers  
**Impact:** WorkerList/WorkerGet query queen, not hive

### 2. WorkerDelete Requires PID
**Decision:** Hive needs PID from queen to kill process  
**Impact:** WorkerDelete operation needs queen integration

### 3. Graceful Shutdown
**Decision:** SIGTERM ‚Üí wait 2s ‚Üí SIGKILL  
**Impact:** Workers should handle SIGTERM gracefully

### 4. Platform-Specific Implementation
**Decision:** Unix-only for now  
**Impact:** Windows support deferred

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### For TEAM-273 (Job Router Integration)
- ‚úÖ WorkerSpawn is fully implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WorkerList/WorkerGet redirect to queen (expected)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WorkerDelete needs PID from queen (expected)
- Verify all operations compile and run

### For Future Teams (Queen Integration)
1. **Implement Worker Registry in Queen**
   - Track workers via heartbeats
   - Store PID, port, model_id, device, status

2. **Implement WorkerList Handler in Queen**
   - Query registry
   - Return worker list

3. **Implement WorkerGet Handler in Queen**
   - Query registry
   - Return worker details

4. **Enhance WorkerDelete in Queen**
   - Get PID from registry
   - Forward to hive with PID
   - Remove from registry after confirmation

### Port Allocation Enhancement
```rust
pub struct PortAllocator {
    used_ports: Arc<Mutex<HashSet<u16>>>,
    next_port: Arc<Mutex<u16>>,
}
```
