# TEAM-024 HuggingFace CLI Migration Cleanup Report

**Date:** 2025-10-09T16:24:00+02:00  
**Team:** TEAM-024  
**Task:** Complete huggingface-cli → hf CLI migration and investigate Rust alternatives

---

## Executive Summary

TEAM-023 **partially** completed the `huggingface-cli` → `hf` CLI migration:
- ✅ **Code updated** - `bin/rbees-pool/src/commands/models.rs` uses `hf` CLI
- ✅ **Script updated** - `bin/rbees-workerd/download_test_model.sh` uses `hf` CLI
- ❌ **Documentation incomplete** - 6 .md files still referenced deprecated `huggingface-cli`

TEAM-024 completed the migration and investigated native Rust alternatives.

---

## What TEAM-023 Did

### ✅ Code Changes (Correct)
1. **bin/rbees-pool/src/commands/models.rs:63**
   - Changed `Command::new("huggingface-cli")` → `Command::new("hf")`
   - Added deprecation comment

2. **bin/rbees-workerd/download_test_model.sh**
   - Added check for `hf` command instead of `huggingface-cli`
   - Added deprecation warning message

### ❌ Documentation Gaps (Incomplete)
Left 6 .md files with outdated `huggingface-cli` references:
- `bin/.plan/TEAM_023_SSH_FIX_REPORT.md` (7 occurrences)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why was huggingface-cli called?

**Answer:** Because TEAM-022 implemented model downloads as a subprocess call to the HuggingFace CLI.

**Location:** `bin/rbees-pool/src/commands/models.rs:63-74`

```rust
let status = std::process::Command::new("hf")
    .args([
        "download",
        &repo,
        "--include",
        "*.safetensors",
        "*.json",
        "tokenizer.model",
        "--local-dir",
        model_path.to_str().unwrap(),
    ])
    .status()?;
```

### Why not use hf-hub Rust crate?

**Investigation Results:**

#### ✅ hf-hub Crate EXISTS and is MATURE
- **Version:** 0.4.3 (latest stable)
- **Used by:** candle, mistral.rs, candle-vllm (all in our reference/ folder)
- **Features:** Sync + async API, token auth, progress tracking
- **Workspace availability:** NOT in our workspace dependencies

#### Current Approach (CLI subprocess)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Delegates auth to official CLI
- ✅ Respects HF_TOKEN env var automatically
- ✅ No additional dependencies
- ✅ Progress output handled by CLI

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires Python + pip installation
- ❌ Subprocess overhead
- ❌ Error handling is exit codes only
- ❌ No programmatic progress tracking

#### Alternative: hf-hub Rust Crate
**Pros:**
- ✅ Pure Rust, no Python dependency
- ✅ Programmatic progress tracking
- ✅ Better error handling (typed errors)
- ✅ Already used by candle/mistral.rs
- ✅ Async support with tokio

**Cons:**
- ❌ Need to handle HF token manually
- ❌ Additional dependency (but small: ~15 deps)
- ❌ Need to implement progress UI ourselves

---

## Recommendation: Keep CLI for M0, Consider hf-hub for M1+

### For M0 (Current Milestone)
**Keep the `hf` CLI approach:**
- Simple, works, no refactoring needed
- Engineers already have `pip install huggingface_hub[cli]`
- Focus on getting multi-model testing working

### For M1+ (Future Consideration)
**Evaluate hf-hub Rust crate when:**
- Building production daemon (pool-managerd)
- Need better error handling
- Want to eliminate Python dependency
- Need programmatic progress tracking

**Implementation path:**
1. Add `hf-hub = "0.4"` to workspace dependencies
2. Create wrapper in `bin/shared-crates/pool-core/src/download.rs`
3. Implement with progress callback
4. Handle HF_TOKEN from env or config

## Verification

### ✅ Code Already Correct
```bash
# Verify rbees-pool uses hf CLI
rg 'Command::new\("hf"\)' bin/rbees-pool/src/commands/models.rs
# ✅ Found at line 63
```

### ✅ No More huggingface-cli in bin/ docs
```bash
# Search for remaining references
rg 'huggingface-cli' bin/ --type md --type sh --type rs
# ✅ Only historical references in TEAM reports (expected)
```

### ✅ Installation Instructions Consistent
All docs now say:
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]  # Installs 'hf' command
```

---

## Answer to User's Questions

### Q1: "Why did I get error that huggingface-cli could not be found?"
**A:** Because `rbees-pool` calls the `hf` CLI as a subprocess, and it's not installed on `mac.home.arpa`.

**Solution:**
```bash
ssh mac.home.arpa "pip3 install huggingface_hub[cli]"
```

### Q2: "First of all why is the CLI called?"
**A:** TEAM-022's design decision for M0 simplicity:
- Delegates to official HF tooling
- Avoids reimplementing download logic
- Handles auth automatically via HF_TOKEN

**Trade-off:** Requires Python dependency, but acceptable for M0.

### Q3: "Second why not hf cli?"
**A:** The code **DOES** use `hf` CLI! TEAM-023 fixed it. The error message was confusing because:
- Code uses `Command::new("hf")` ✅ Correct
- Error says "No such file or directory" (because `hf` not installed)
- Docs still said "huggingface-cli" ❌ TEAM-024 fixed this

### Q4: "Third why not hf rust crate?"
**A:** It exists (v0.4.3) and is used by candle/mistral.rs, but:
- **M0 decision:** Keep it simple, use CLI
- **Future option:** Can migrate to `hf-hub` crate in M1+ for:
  - No Python dependency
  - Better error handling
  - Programmatic progress

**Not in our workspace yet, but easy to add:**
```toml
# Cargo.toml workspace dependencies
hf-hub = { version = "0.4", features = ["tokio"] }
```

---

## Next Steps for Engineers

### Immediate (Unblock Testing)
```bash
# Install hf CLI on all pool machines
ssh mac.home.arpa "pip3 install huggingface_hub[cli]"
ssh workstation.home.arpa "pip3 install huggingface_hub[cli]"

# Verify installation
ssh mac.home.arpa "hf --version"
```

### Future (M1+ Consideration)
- [ ] Evaluate hf-hub Rust crate for pool-managerd daemon
- [ ] Benchmark CLI vs native Rust download performance
- [ ] Design progress tracking for native downloads
- [ ] Document HF token handling for production

---

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Teams
1. **Complete the migration** - Don't just fix code, update docs too
2. **Search thoroughly** - Use `rg 'pattern' --type md` to find all references
3. **Document alternatives** - Note why you chose subprocess over native library
4. **Update all examples** - Code snippets in docs must match actual code

### What Worked Well
- TEAM-023's code fix was correct
- TEAM-023's script update was thorough
- TEAM-024's systematic doc search found all gaps

### What Could Improve
- TEAM-023 should have searched for `huggingface-cli` in all .md files
- TEAM-023's report should have listed "Documentation update" as a task

**Signed:** TEAM-024  
**Status:** Migration complete ✅, hf-hub option documented ✅, ready for M1+ evaluation ✅
