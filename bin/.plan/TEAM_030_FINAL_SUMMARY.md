# TEAM-030 Final Summary - Architecture Corrected ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-10T00:51:00+02:00  
**Team:** TEAM-030  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - All files updated**

---

## What Happened

### Initial Mistake (Corrected)
- ❌ Mistakenly deleted BOTH worker-registry AND model-catalog
- ✅ User caught the error immediately
- ✅ Restored model-catalog from git
- ✅ Updated all code references

### Final Architecture (CORRECT)

**Worker Registry:**
- ✅ In-memory HashMap (ephemeral)
- ✅ No SQLite
- ✅ Lives in rbee-hive process memory
- ✅ Lost on restart (by design)

**Model Catalog:**
- ✅ SQLite database (persistent)
- ✅ Location: `~/.rbee/models.db`
- ✅ Survives restarts
- ✅ Prevents re-downloading models

---

## Files Updated

### Code Files (8 files)
1. ✅ `Cargo.toml` - Removed worker-registry, kept model-catalog
2. ✅ `bin/rbee-hive/Cargo.toml` - Kept model-catalog dependency
3. ✅ `bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs` - Restored catalog init
4. ✅ `bin/rbee-hive/src/http/routes.rs` - Restored catalog in AppState
5. ✅ `bin/rbee-hive/src/http/workers.rs` - Restored catalog usage
6. ✅ `bin/rbee-keeper/Cargo.toml` - Removed worker-registry
7. ✅ `bin/rbee-keeper/src/commands/infer.rs` - Ephemeral mode
8. ✅ `bin/queen-rbee/Cargo.toml` - Commented SQLx (M1+)

### Test Files (5 files)
1. ✅ `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001.md` - Updated architecture notes
2. ✅ `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp.md` - Added architecture section, updated Phase 1 & 6
3. ✅ `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-preflight.sh` - Updated SQLite comment
4. ✅ `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-local.sh` - Added architecture header
5. ✅ `bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-run.sh` - Added architecture header

### Documentation Files (3 files)
1. ✅ `bin/.specs/ARCHITECTURE_MODES.md` - Complete architecture doc
2. ✅ `bin/.plan/TEAM_030_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Corrected summary
3. ✅ `bin/.plan/TEAM_030_HANDOFF.md` - Handoff to TEAM-031

## Verification

### Build Status ✅
```bash
cargo check --workspace
# Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 16.65s
```

### Test Status ✅
```bash
cargo test -p rbee-hive
# test result: ok. 11 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

### Architecture Verification ✅
- ✅ Worker registry: In-memory (no SQLite)
- ✅ Model catalog: SQLite at ~/.rbee/models.db
- ✅ All references updated
- ✅ All tests pass

## Key Insight

**Different lifecycles require different storage:**

| Component | Lifecycle | Storage | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Workers | Ephemeral | In-memory | Transient processes, no persistence needed |
| Models | Persistent | SQLite | Large files, avoid re-downloading |

This is the **optimal** architecture for the use case! 🎯

---

## What Was Deleted

- ✅ `bin/shared-crates/worker-registry/` (entire crate)
  - ~300 lines of SQLite code
  - Workers don't need persistent storage

## What Was Kept

- ✅ `bin/shared-crates/model-catalog/` (entire crate)
  - SQLite-based model tracking
  - Models DO need persistent storage

---

## Next Steps for TEAM-031

1. **Download model file** (blocker)
   ```bash
   cd bin/llm-worker-rbee && ./download_test_model.sh
   ```

2. **Run preflight check**
   ```bash
   ./bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-preflight.sh
   ```

3. **Run E2E test**
   ```bash
   ./bin/.specs/.gherkin/test-001-mvp-local.sh
   ```

4. **Verify:**
   - Model catalog exists: `ls ~/.rbee/models.db`
   - No lingering workers: `ps aux | grep llm-worker-rbee`
   - VRAM cleaned after shutdown

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Read requirements carefully** - Worker registry ≠ Model catalog
2. **Different lifecycles need different storage** - Not everything needs SQLite
3. **User feedback is critical** - Caught the mistake immediately
4. **Git is your friend** - Easy rollback with `git checkout`

**All files updated. Architecture is now correct. Ready for E2E testing!** 🚀
