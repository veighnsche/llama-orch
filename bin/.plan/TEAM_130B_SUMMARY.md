# TEAM-130B SUMMARY

**📖 NOTE: This is a HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY for managers and quick reference.**

**👉 For actual execution, use: `TEAM_130B_PHASED_APPROACH.md`**

---

**Mission:** Synthesize all investigations + peer reviews → Create definitive, actionable investigation files

**Duration:** 9-12 days (3 phases)

**Key Principle:** Build COMPLETE mental model of entire system before writing!

---

## 📅 3 PHASES

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-4)
**Goal:** Read everything, build complete mental model

**Activities:**
- Read 20+ investigation and peer review documents
- Reconcile all conflicts with independent verification
- Analyze shared crate usage across ALL 4 binaries

**Output:** 
- `TEAM_130B_CROSS_BINARY_ANALYSIS.md` (20-25 pages)

**✅ Checkpoint:** Full context of entire system acquired!

---

### Phase 2: First Two Binaries (Days 5-8)
**Goal:** Write rbee-hive and queen-rbee investigations

**Why these first?**
- rbee-hive = Largest (10 crates), sets quality bar
- queen-rbee = Critical security fixes (auth-min, russh)

**Output (6 files):**

**rbee-hive:**
1. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-hive_PART1_METRICS.md` (15-20 pages)
2. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-hive_PART2_LIBRARIES.md` (15-20 pages)
3. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-hive_PART3_MIGRATION.md` (10-15 pages)

**queen-rbee:**
4. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_queen-rbee_PART1_METRICS.md` (15-20 pages)
5. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_queen-rbee_PART2_LIBRARIES.md` (15-20 pages)
6. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_queen-rbee_PART3_MIGRATION.md` (10-15 pages)

**✅ Checkpoint:** 2 binaries complete, quality bar established!

---

### Phase 3: Final Two Binaries (Days 9-12)
**Goal:** Write llm-worker-rbee and rbee-keeper investigations

**Why these last?**
- llm-worker-rbee = Apply learnings from queen-rbee
- rbee-keeper = Most independent, CLI-focused

**Output (6 files):**

**llm-worker-rbee:**
7. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_llm-worker-rbee_PART1_METRICS.md` (15-20 pages)
8. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_llm-worker-rbee_PART2_LIBRARIES.md` (15-20 pages)
9. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_llm-worker-rbee_PART3_MIGRATION.md` (10-15 pages)

**rbee-keeper:**
10. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-keeper_PART1_METRICS.md` (15-20 pages)
11. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-keeper_PART2_LIBRARIES.md` (15-20 pages)
12. `TEAM_130B_FINAL_rbee-keeper_PART3_MIGRATION.md` (10-15 pages)

**✅ Final Checkpoint:** All 4 binaries complete!

---

## 📦 FINAL DELIVERABLES

**13 files, ~220 pages total**

### Phase 1 Output:
1. Cross-binary analysis (1 file, 20-25 pages)

### Phase 2 & 3 Output:
2-13. Per-binary investigations (12 files, ~180 pages)

**Each binary = 3 parts:**
- Part 1: Metrics & Crate Decomposition (15-20 pages)
- Part 2: Shared Crates & External Libraries (15-20 pages)
- Part 3: Migration & Approval (10-15 pages)

---

## 🎯 WHY 3 PARTS PER BINARY?

### Avoid Token Limits
- ❌ 60-page file = Token limit exceeded
- ✅ 3 × 20-page files = Token friendly

### Manageable Chunks
- ✅ Easier to write
- ✅ Easier to review
- ✅ Clear stopping points

### Logical Separation
- Part 1 = What we're decomposing (metrics, crates)
- Part 2 = What libraries we're using (shared + external)
- Part 3 = How we're doing it (migration, risks)

---

## 🔑 KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Complete Phase 1 Fully
**DON'T rush to write!**
- Read all 20+ documents
- Build mental model of entire system
- Cross-binary analysis is the MOST VALUABLE output

### 2. Write With Full Context
**Every Part 2 must reference cross-binary analysis!**
- auth-min standardization affects ALL binaries
- SSH client sharing (queen-rbee + rbee-keeper)
- Type sharing opportunities

### 3. Be Specific & Actionable
**NOT acceptable:**
> "Use better libraries"

**Acceptable:**
> "Replace manual SSH with russh = '0.40' because:
> - Fixes command injection vulnerability (CRITICAL)
> - Pure Rust, no system deps
> - Migration: ~200 LOC, 8-10 hours
> - Code example: [show before/after]"

## 📊 EFFORT BREAKDOWN

| Phase | Days | Files | Pages | Hours |
|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 3-4 | 1 | 20-25 | 24-32 |
| Phase 2 | 3-4 | 6 | ~90 | 24-32 |
| Phase 3 | 3-4 | 6 | ~90 | 24-32 |
| **TOTAL** | **9-12** | **13** | **~220** | **72-96** |

**With 2-3 people:** 24-48 hours per person over ~2 weeks
