# TEAM-130B: PHASED SYNTHESIS APPROACH

**Duration:** 9-12 days (3 phases √ó 3-4 days each)  
**Team Size:** 2-3 people  
**Status:** üéØ PHASED EXECUTION

---

## üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE

**Team 130B MUST have ENTIRE CONTEXT of ALL 4 binaries before writing anything!**

**Why:** Cross-binary shared crate opportunities are the most valuable findings!

**Therefore:**
- Phase 1 = Read EVERYTHING, build mental model of entire system
- Phase 2 & 3 = Write final investigations with full context

---

## üìä DOCUMENT STRUCTURE (Avoid Token Limits)

Instead of one 40-60 page file per binary, split into **3 parts:**

### Per Binary (3 files √ó 4 binaries = 12 files):

**Part 1: Metrics & Crate Decomposition** (15-20 pages)
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_[binary]_PART1_METRICS.md`
- Ground truth metrics
- Proposed crate decomposition
- Each crate detailed

**Part 2: Shared Crates & External Libraries** (15-20 pages)
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_[binary]_PART2_LIBRARIES.md`
- Shared crate usage analysis
- External Rust library recommendations
- Cross-binary recommendations

**Part 3: Migration & Approval** (10-15 pages)
- `TEAM_130B_FINAL_[binary]_PART3_MIGRATION.md`
- Architecture decisions
- Step-by-step migration strategy
- Risk assessment
- Test coverage
- Recommendations & approval

**Total per binary:** 40-55 pages (split into 3 manageable files)

---

3. Proposed Crate Decomposition (10-14 pages)
   - All 10 crates detailed with:
     - LOC, purpose, files, dependencies
     - Justification
     - External library suggestions for THIS crate
     - Approval status

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME BREAKDOWN

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | 3-4 days | 1 cross-binary doc | 24-32 hours |
| Phase 2 | 3-4 days | 6 files (2 binaries) | 24-32 hours |
| Phase 3 | 3-4 days | 6 files (2 binaries) | 24-32 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **9-12 days** | **13 files** | **72-96 hours** |

## ‚úÖ BENEFITS OF PHASED APPROACH

### Manageable Chunks
- ‚úÖ No 60-page documents in one sitting
- ‚úÖ 15-20 page chunks are token-friendly
- ‚úÖ Clear stopping points

### Full Context Maintained
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 builds complete mental model
- ‚úÖ Cross-binary analysis done FIRST
- ‚úÖ Can reference earlier phases when writing later binaries

### Parallel Work Possible
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Person A writes rbee-hive, Person B writes queen-rbee
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Person A writes llm-worker, Person B writes rbee-keeper

### Progressive Delivery
- ‚úÖ After Phase 1: Teams have cross-binary guidance
- ‚úÖ After Phase 2: 2 binaries ready for Phase 2 (Preparation)
- ‚úÖ After Phase 3: All 4 binaries ready

---

## üéØ PHASE FOCUS

### Phase 1: CONTEXT IS KING
- Read everything
- Understand the system as a whole
- Identify cross-binary patterns
- No rushing to write

### Phase 2: CRITICAL PATH
- rbee-hive (largest complexity)
- queen-rbee (critical security fixes)
- Set the quality bar

### Phase 3: COMPLETE THE PICTURE
- llm-worker-rbee (worker pattern)
- rbee-keeper (CLI tool)
- Apply learnings from Phase 2

---

## üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Start writing before reading everything (Phase 1 is mandatory!)
- ‚ùå Write one binary in isolation (lose cross-binary opportunities)
- ‚ùå Skip cross-binary analysis (most valuable output!)
- ‚ùå Try to write all 3 parts of one binary in one day (too much!)

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1 fully before starting Phase 2
- ‚úÖ Write with full system context
- ‚úÖ Reference cross-binary analysis in every Part 2
- ‚úÖ Take breaks between parts

---

## üìû COORDINATION

### Phase Gates:
1. **End of Phase 1:** Review cross-binary analysis as team
2. **End of Phase 2:** Review first 2 binaries, adjust approach if needed
3. **End of Phase 3:** Final review all 13 documents

### Daily Standups:
- What did you read/write yesterday?
- What conflicts did you find?
- What cross-binary opportunities emerged?
- Any blockers?

### Slack Channels:
- `#team-130b-phase1` - Reading & analysis
- `#team-130b-phase2` - Writing rbee-hive & queen-rbee
- `#team-130b-phase3` - Writing llm-worker & rbee-keeper
