# TEAM-351 Step 1: Tests Complete ✅

**Date:** Oct 29, 2025  
**Package:** @rbee/shared-config  
**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING

---

## Summary

Created **51 comprehensive tests** for @rbee/shared-config with **100% pass rate**.

---

## Over-Engineering Removed

### ❌ Deleted Runtime Validation
**Removed:** Lines 16-64 from `ports.ts`
- Deleted `isValidPort()` function
- Deleted runtime validation loop
- Deleted `MIN_PORT` and `MAX_PORT` constants

**Why:** TypeScript already enforces type safety at compile time. Runtime validation of hardcoded constants is unnecessary overhead.

**Impact:** -48 lines of unnecessary code

---

## Tests Created

### Test File
- `src/ports.test.ts` - 51 tests covering all functions

### Test Coverage

**PORTS constant (6 tests)**
- ✅ Correct structure
- ✅ Keeper ports (dev: 5173, prod: null)
- ✅ Queen ports (dev: 7834, prod: 7833, backend: 7833)
- ✅ Hive ports (dev: 7836, prod: 7835, backend: 7835)
- ✅ Worker ports (dev: 7837, prod: 8080, backend: 8080)
- ✅ Readonly (as const)

**getAllowedOrigins() (7 tests)**
- ✅ Returns HTTP origins by default
- ✅ Excludes keeper
- ✅ Includes HTTPS when requested
- ✅ No HTTPS for dev ports
- ✅ Returns sorted array
- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ Consistent results

**getIframeUrl() (10 tests)**
- ✅ Dev/prod URLs for queen, hive, worker, keeper
- ✅ Throws error for keeper prod
- ✅ HTTPS support for dev and prod

**getParentOrigin() (8 tests)**
- ✅ Returns keeper dev for all dev ports
- ✅ Returns wildcard for all prod ports
- ✅ Returns wildcard for unknown ports

**getServiceUrl() (17 tests)**
- ✅ Dev mode URLs for all services
- ✅ Prod mode URLs for all services
- ✅ Backend mode URLs for all services
- ✅ HTTPS support in all modes
- ✅ Default parameters (dev mode, HTTP)

**Edge cases (3 tests)**
- ✅ Handles all service names
- ✅ Returns consistent URLs
- ✅ Handles null ports gracefully

- **Pool:** vmThreads
- **Environment:** node
- **Globals:** enabled

### Files
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Excludes test files from build
- `package.json` - Test scripts

---

## Verification

### Build Status
```bash
✅ pnpm build - Success
✅ pnpm test - 51/51 tests passing
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No runtime errors
```

### Product Code Quality
- ✅ No over-engineering
- ✅ No runtime validation of constants
- ✅ Simple, clean functions
- ✅ Type-safe with `as const`

## Next Steps

**Ready for Steps 2, 3, 4:**
- Create tests for `@rbee/narration-client`
- Create tests for `@rbee/iframe-bridge`
- Create tests for `@rbee/dev-utils`
