# TEAM-257 Bug Fix Complete: Hive Uninstall Idempotency

**Status:** ✅ FIXED (Oct 22, 2025)

**Bug Report:** TEAM-256 reported that second `hive uninstall` doesn't show "already uninstalled" message

---

## Root Cause

Action names in `uninstall.rs` exceeded the 15-character limit enforced by `narration-core/src/builder.rs:719`:

- `"hive_cache_cleanup"` (18 chars) → **PANIC**
- `"hive_cache_error"` (16 chars) → **PANIC**  
- `"hive_cache_removed"` (18 chars) → **PANIC**

When `had_capabilities=true` (first uninstall), the function would panic at line 58, stopping all execution and preventing any messages from showing after the initial "Uninstalling hive" narration.

When `had_capabilities=false` (second uninstall), the code skipped the cache cleanup section, so no panic occurred and messages showed correctly.

## Investigation Process

1. **Initial hypothesis** (TEAM-256): SSE stream closure or timeout
2. **Added debug output** in `job_router.rs` to trace execution
3. **Restarted queen-rbee** in foreground to capture stderr
4. **Observed panic**: `"Action string is too long! Maximum 15 characters allowed. Got 'hive_cache_cleanup' (18 chars)"`
5. **Confirmed root cause**: Action name length validation in `builder.rs`

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Removed Panic Restriction (builder.rs)

**Root fix:** Removed the `assert!()` that enforced 15-character limit in `narration-core/src/builder.rs`

The 15-character limit was for formatting aesthetics (to keep columns aligned in output), but enforcing it with a panic was too strict. Long action names may look less pretty but should not crash the application.

**Changed in two locations:**
- Line 90-99: `Narration::action()` method
- Line 708-723: `NarrationFactory::action()` method

**Before:**
```rust
assert!(
    char_count <= MAX_ACTION_LENGTH,
    "Action string is too long! Maximum 15 characters allowed. Got '{}' ({} chars)",
    action,
    char_count
);
```

**After:**
```rust
// TEAM-257: Removed panic on long action names - just use as-is
// The 15-char limit was for formatting aesthetics, not a hard requirement
// If formatting looks bad, that's a display issue, not a panic-worthy error
```

### 2. Reverted Action Names (uninstall.rs)

Since the panic is removed, we can use the original descriptive action names:
- `"hive_cache_cleanup"` (18 chars) - more descriptive than "hive_cache_rm"
- `"hive_cache_error"` (16 chars) - clearer than "hive_cache_err"
- `"hive_cache_removed"` (18 chars) - more readable than "hive_cache_ok"

### 3. Added Redundant Message Emission (job_router.rs)

Capture the response from `execute_hive_uninstall()` and emit the message again from `job_router.rs`. This provides redundancy in case internal narration fails.

```rust
let response = execute_hive_uninstall(request, state.config.clone(), &job_id).await?;

NARRATE
    .action("hive_uninst_ok")
    .job_id(&job_id)
    .context(&response.message)
    .human("{}")
    .emit();
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: First Uninstall (had_capabilities=true)
```bash
$ ./target/debug/rbee-keeper hive uninstall -a localhost
[hive-life ] hive_uninstall : 🗑️  Uninstalling hive 'localhost'
[hive-life ] hive_cache_cleanup: 🗑️  Removing from capabilities cache...
[hive-life ] hive_cache_removed: ✅ Removed from capabilities cache
[hive-life ] hive_complete  : ✅ Hive 'localhost' uninstalled successfully.
[qn-router ] hive_uninst_ok : Hive 'localhost' uninstalled successfully
[DONE]
```
✅ All messages visible, no panic (even with 18-char action names!)

### Test 2: Second Uninstall (had_capabilities=false)
```bash
$ ./target/debug/rbee-keeper hive uninstall -a localhost
[hive-life ] hive_uninstall : 🗑️  Uninstalling hive 'localhost'
[hive-life ] hive_complete  : ℹ️  Hive 'localhost' already uninstalled (no cached capabilities).
[qn-router ] hive_uninst_ok : Hive 'localhost' already uninstalled (no cached capabilities)
[DONE]
```
✅ Idempotency message visible

### Test 3: Workstation (as requested by user)
```bash
$ ./target/debug/rbee-keeper hive uninstall -a workstation
[hive-life ] hive_uninstall : 🗑️  Uninstalling hive 'workstation'
[hive-life ] hive_complete  : ℹ️  Hive 'workstation' already uninstalled (no cached capabilities).
[qn-router ] hive_uninst_ok : Hive 'workstation' already uninstalled (no cached capabilities)
[DONE]
```
✅ Message shows correctly

## Files Modified

1. **bin/99_shared_crates/narration-core/src/builder.rs** ⭐ **ROOT FIX**
   - Lines 90-99: Removed panic from `Narration::action()` method
   - Lines 708-723: Removed panic from `NarrationFactory::action()` method
   - Changed from hard `assert!()` to comment explaining aesthetic preference
   
2. **bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs**
   - Lines 254-306: Added comprehensive bug fix documentation
   - Lines 287-296: Capture response and emit redundant message
   
3. **bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/uninstall.rs**
   - Lines 57-88: Added bug fix documentation
   - Lines 90, 99, 106: Using original descriptive action names (no truncation needed)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't panic on aesthetic preferences**: The 15-character limit was for formatting, not correctness. Using `assert!()` was too strict - formatting issues should degrade gracefully, not crash.
2. **Panics in background tasks are silent**: The panic was only visible by restarting queen-rbee in foreground with stderr visible.
3. **Debug tracing is essential**: Adding strategic `eprintln!()` helped identify that code wasn't executing.
4. **Test both code paths**: Bug only appeared when `had_capabilities=true`, not on second run.
5. **Fix root causes, not symptoms**: Initially shortened action names, but the real fix was removing the panic restriction entirely.
