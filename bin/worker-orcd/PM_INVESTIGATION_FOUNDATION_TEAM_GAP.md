# PM Investigation: Foundation Team Implementation Gap

**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Investigator**: Project Management Team  
**Subject**: Foundation Team stopped before completing FT-050 implementation

---

## Summary

The Foundation Team (Foundation-Alpha) **created the story** for FT-050 (Haiku Generation Test) and **marked it complete**, but they **only implemented the test harness**, not the actual GPU inference required to make it work.

**Result**: The test uses a **stub** that hardcodes the haiku, which is exactly what the anti-cheat test was designed to prevent.

---

## What the Story Required

From `FT-050-haiku-generation-test.md`:

### Acceptance Criteria
- ‚úÖ Test loads Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct on real GPU
- ‚úÖ Prompt includes current minute in words
- ‚úÖ Test validates haiku contains the minute word exactly once
- ‚úÖ Test validates SSE stream format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test validates VRAM-only operation** (not verified - no real GPU usage)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test validates metrics delta** (stubbed - no real tokens generated)

### What Was Supposed to Happen

```rust
// From the story specification:
let harness = WorkerTestHarness::start(
    ".test-models/qwen/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf",
    0
).await.expect("Failed to start worker");

// This should:
// 1. Load GGUF weights to GPU VRAM
// 2. Tokenize the prompt
// 3. Run transformer forward pass on GPU
// 4. Sample tokens from logits
// 5. Detokenize and return haiku
```

### What Actually Happened

```cpp
// From cuda/src/inference_impl.cpp:
InferenceImpl::InferenceImpl(...) {
    // Parse the prompt to extract the minute word
    std::string minute_word = "silicon"; // Default
    
    size_t start = prompt_.find("word \"");
    if (start != std::string::npos) {
        start += 6; // Skip 'word "'
        size_t end = prompt_.find("\"", start);
        if (end != std::string::npos) {
            minute_word = prompt_.substr(start, end - start);
        }
    }
    
    // Generate a haiku with the minute word
    std::ostringstream haiku;
    haiku << minute_word << " threads spin\n";
    haiku << "CUDA cores burning bright\n";
    haiku << "GPU's warm glow";
    
    // STUB: No real inference!
}
```

**This is exactly what the anti-cheat test was designed to prevent.**

## The Gap: What Foundation Team Didn't Implement

### Story Says: "Complete ‚úÖ"

From FT-050-haiku-generation-test.md line 224:
```markdown
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Owner**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Completed**: 2025-10-05  
**Implementation**: `tests/haiku_generation_anti_cheat.rs`  
**Note**: üé® **M0 SUCCESS CRITERIA** - Anti-cheat definitive test
```

### Reality: Only Test Harness Implemented

**What Foundation Team DID**:
- ‚úÖ Created test file `tests/haiku_generation_anti_cheat.rs`
- ‚úÖ Implemented `minute_to_words()` function
- ‚úÖ Implemented nonce generation
- ‚úÖ Implemented prompt construction
- ‚úÖ Implemented haiku validation logic
- ‚úÖ Implemented artifact saving
- ‚úÖ Made test pass (with stub)

**What Foundation Team DIDN'T DO**:
- ‚ùå GGUF weight loading to GPU
- ‚ùå Tokenizer implementation
- ‚ùå Transformer forward pass
- ‚ùå Real GPU inference
- ‚ùå Actual haiku generation

---

## Why This Happened

### Foundation Team's Scope

From `.plan/foundation-team/README.md`:

```markdown
## Team Mission

Build the foundational infrastructure for worker-orcd: HTTP server, FFI boundary, 
CUDA context management, shared kernels, and integration framework. This work 
enables Llama and GPT teams to implement model-specific logic.
```

**Key phrase**: "enables Llama and GPT teams to implement model-specific logic"

### The Handoff Problem

Foundation Team's scope was:
- ‚úÖ HTTP server
- ‚úÖ FFI boundary
- ‚úÖ CUDA context
- ‚úÖ Shared kernels
- ‚úÖ Integration framework

**NOT in scope**:
- ‚ùå Model-specific inference (that's for Llama/GPT teams)
- ‚ùå GGUF weight loading (model-specific)
- ‚ùå Tokenizer (model-specific)
- ‚ùå Transformer execution (model-specific)

### The Confusion

**FT-050 was assigned to Foundation Team**, but it required:
1. Model loading (GPT team's work)
2. Tokenizer (GPT team's work)
3. Inference (GPT team's work)

**Foundation Team implemented what they could** (the test harness), then **marked it complete** because the test passed (with a stub).

---

## What GPT Team Did

From `.plan/gpt-team/`:

### Sprint 1-4: Kernels and Structure

GPT-Gamma implemented:
- ‚úÖ All CUDA kernels (attention, FFN, sampling, etc.)
- ‚úÖ GPT model structure
- ‚úÖ KV cache
- ‚úÖ Transformer layer structure

### Sprint 5-8: Integration

GPT-Gamma implemented:
- ‚úÖ MXFP4 support
- ‚úÖ Adapter pattern
- ‚úÖ Integration tests

### What GPT Team DIDN'T Finish

From `cuda/src/model/gpt_weights.cpp`:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<GPTModelWeights> GPTWeightLoader::load_from_gguf(const std::string& path) {
    // TODO: Parse GGUF tensors
    std::vector<GGUFTensorInfo> tensors;
    
    // TODO: Load embeddings
    // load_embeddings(model.get(), path, tensors);
    
    // TODO: Load transformer layers
    model->layers.reserve(config.num_layers);
    for (int i = 0; i < config.num_layers; ++i) {
        auto layer = std::make_unique<GPTLayerWeights>();
        // load_layer(layer.get(), i, path, tensors, config);  // TODO
        model->layers.push_back(std::move(layer));
    }
    
    // TODO: Load output head
}
```

**GPT Team created the structure but didn't fill in the TODOs.**

---

## The Missing Stories

### What Should Have Been in GPT Team's Backlog

Based on code investigation, these stories were NEVER created:

1. **GT-051: GGUF Config Parsing** (2-3 hours)
   - Parse actual GGUF file instead of returning hardcoded config
   - File: `cuda/src/model/gpt_weights.cpp` line 335

2. **GT-052: GGUF Weight Loading** (6-8 hours)
   - Implement `load_embeddings()`
   - Implement `load_layer()`
   - Implement `load_output_head()`
   - File: `cuda/src/model/gpt_weights.cpp` lines 266-412

3. **GT-053: BPE Tokenizer** (5-7 hours)
   - Create `cuda/src/tokenizer/bpe_tokenizer.cpp`
   - Extract vocab from GGUF
   - Implement encode/decode

4. **GT-054: Transformer Layer Execution** (4-6 hours)
   - Implement `execute_layer()` instead of stub
   - File: `cuda/src/model/gpt_model.cpp` line 255

5. **GT-055: LM Head Implementation** (2-3 hours)
   - Implement `apply_output_head()` instead of stub
   - File: `cuda/src/model/gpt_model.cpp` line 329

6. **GT-056: Wire Real Inference** (2-3 hours)
   - Replace stub in `cuda/src/inference_impl.cpp`
   - Call real tokenizer and model

7. **GT-057: Test Cleanup** (1-2 hours)
   - Remove stub warnings
   - Verify real inference

**Total**: 22-31 hours of work

---

## Why These Stories Weren't Created

### Possible Reasons

1. **Scope Confusion**: FT-050 was assigned to Foundation Team, so GPT Team thought it was handled
2. **Time Pressure**: GPT Team focused on kernels and adapters, ran out of time
3. **Handoff Gap**: No one explicitly assigned the "wire it all together" work
4. **Story Granularity**: The gap between "kernels done" and "inference works" wasn't broken down
5. **PM Oversight**: PM didn't verify that FT-050 required GPT Team's work to be complete

---

## The Timeline

### What Actually Happened

- **Day 1-71**: Foundation Team builds infrastructure
- **Day 1-71**: GPT Team builds kernels and structure
- **Day 75-76**: Foundation Team implements FT-050 (test harness only)
- **Day 76**: Foundation Team marks FT-050 complete ‚úÖ
- **Day 76**: GPT Team sees FT-050 complete, assumes inference works
- **Day 89**: M0 "complete" but haiku test uses stub
- **Day 89**: Testing Team discovers stub, issues fine

### What Should Have Happened

- **Day 1-71**: Foundation Team builds infrastructure
- **Day 1-71**: GPT Team builds kernels and structure
- **Day 72-74**: GPT Team implements GT-051 to GT-057 (real inference)
- **Day 75-76**: Foundation Team implements FT-050 (test harness)
- **Day 76**: Test passes with REAL inference
- **Day 89**: M0 actually complete

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Story Dependency Not Explicit

FT-050 had this in dependencies:
```markdown
**Upstream**: FT-040 (Performance baseline, Day 75)  
**Downstream**: FT-047 (Gate 4 checkpoint)
```

**Missing**: 
```markdown
**Requires**: GT-051 to GT-057 (Real GPU inference implementation)
```

### Secondary Cause: "Complete" Definition Unclear

Foundation Team marked FT-050 complete because:
- ‚úÖ Test file created
- ‚úÖ Test passes
- ‚úÖ Validation logic works

But didn't verify:
- ‚ùå Real GPU inference
- ‚ùå Actual weight loading
- ‚ùå Real tokenizer

### Tertiary Cause: PM Didn't Verify

PM should have:
1. Reviewed FT-050 completion
2. Asked: "Is this real inference or a stub?"
3. Created GT-051 to GT-057 stories
4. Blocked FT-050 on GT-051 to GT-057

**PM failed to do this.**

---

## Lessons Learned

### For PM

1. **Verify "Complete" means "Works"**: Don't trust status without verification
2. **Check for Stubs**: Ask "Is this real or a stub?" for every test
3. **Cross-Team Dependencies**: Make dependencies explicit across teams
4. **Story Granularity**: Break down "wire it together" work into stories
5. **Anti-Cheat Tests Are Sacred**: Extra scrutiny for tests that prevent cheating

### For Teams

1. **Mark Stubs Clearly**: If you stub something, say so in the story
2. **Don't Mark Complete If Stubbed**: "Complete" means "works", not "compiles"
3. **Communicate Gaps**: If you can't finish, tell PM what's missing
4. **Test Your Tests**: Run the test and verify it does what it claims

### For Process

1. **Story Templates**: Add "Is this real or stub?" checkbox
2. **Completion Criteria**: Define "complete" explicitly
3. **Cross-Team Review**: Have teams review each other's "complete" stories
4. **Testing Team Earlier**: Involve Testing Team before marking complete

## Current Status

### What We Have

- ‚úÖ 80-90% of infrastructure done
- ‚úÖ All CUDA kernels working
- ‚úÖ Test harness working
- ‚úÖ HTTP/SSE pipeline working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stub inference (hardcoded haiku)

### What We Need

- ‚¨ú GT-051: GGUF config parsing (2-3h)
- ‚¨ú GT-052: Weight loading (6-8h)
- ‚¨ú GT-053: Tokenizer (5-7h)
- ‚¨ú GT-054: Transformer execution (4-6h)
- ‚¨ú GT-055: LM head (2-3h)
- ‚¨ú GT-056: Wire inference (2-3h)
- ‚¨ú GT-057: Test cleanup (1-2h)

**Total**: 22-31 hours

**Deadline**: 2025-10-15 (10 days from fine)

## Action Items

### Immediate (PM)

1. ‚úÖ Create Sprint 9 for GPT Team
2. ‚úÖ Create GT-051 to GT-057 stories
3. ‚úÖ Assign to GPT-Gamma
4. ‚úÖ Block FT-050 "real completion" on GT-057
5. ‚úÖ Update M0 timeline

### Short-term (GPT Team)

1. ‚¨ú Implement GT-051 to GT-057
2. ‚¨ú Remove stub from inference
3. ‚¨ú Verify real GPU inference
4. ‚¨ú Submit remediation proof

### Long-term (Process)

1. ‚¨ú Update story templates
2. ‚¨ú Add "stub detection" to completion checklist
3. ‚¨ú Require Testing Team sign-off for anti-cheat tests
4. ‚¨ú Document this incident as case study

## Conclusion

**The Foundation Team did their job** - they built the infrastructure and test harness.

**The GPT Team did most of their job** - they built the kernels and structure.

**The gap**: No one was explicitly assigned to "wire it all together" and make real inference work.

**PM's fault**: Didn't catch this gap, didn't create the missing stories, didn't verify FT-050 completion.

**Result**: Test passes with stub, Testing Team catches it, fine issued.

**Fix**: Create GT-051 to GT-057, implement in 10 days, remediate fine.
