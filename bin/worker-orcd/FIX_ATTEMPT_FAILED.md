# Fix Attempt Failed - 2025-10-06 13:05

## What We Tried

Based on the llama.cpp analysis in `LLAMA_CPP_MATRIX_ANALYSIS.md`, we attempted to fix the matrix multiplication parameters to match llama.cpp's approach.

### The Theory

llama.cpp uses:
```cpp
cblas_sgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasTrans, ...)
```

This means:
- lm_head: NO transpose (CblasNoTrans)
- hidden: YES transpose (CblasTrans)

We tried to translate this to cuBLAS by using `CUBLAS_OP_T` for the lm_head matrix.

### The Implementation

Changed from:
```cpp
cublasGemmEx(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, ...)
```

To:
```cpp
cublasGemmEx(handle, CUBLAS_OP_T, CUBLAS_OP_N, ...)
```

### The Result: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE ‚ùå

**Logits became completely wrong**:
```
Before: -4.69 to +4.45 (with garbage at specific positions)
After:  -142257235689472.00, 534302560.00 (completely broken!)
```

**CUDA errors appeared**:
```
ERROR: Failed to write seq_lens: operation not supported on global/shared address space
ERROR: Failed to read seq_lens: operation not supported on global/shared address space
Null pointer in embedding lookup
RMSNorm kernel launch failed
RoPE ex kernel launch failed
GQA Decode kernel launch failed
```

**Test result**: Complete failure, model crashed

### Why It Failed

The issue is more complex than just changing transpose flags. The problem involves:

1. **Memory layout**: How the tensor is actually laid out in GPU memory
2. **Leading dimensions**: The stride parameters (lda, ldb, ldc) must match the actual memory layout
3. **cuBLAS vs BLAS**: cuBLAS uses column-major by default, BLAS can use row-major

Simply changing `CUBLAS_OP_N` to `CUBLAS_OP_T` without understanding the exact memory layout made things worse.

## What We Learned

### Key Insight 1: The Original Code Partially Works

The original `CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N` parameters produce:
- ‚úÖ Correct logits for most positions (0-999 checked)
- ‚ùå Garbage logits at specific positions (8850, 44394, 137131, 63299)

This suggests the GEMM is mostly correct but has issues with specific memory locations.

### Key Insight 2: The Problem Might Not Be GEMM Parameters

Given that:
- Most logits are correct
- Only specific positions have garbage
- The garbage positions are scattered (not sequential)

The issue might be:
1. **Tensor loading bug**: Specific positions in lm_head not loaded correctly
2. **Memory corruption**: Something overwrites specific positions
3. **Alignment issue**: GPU memory alignment causes issues at specific addresses

### Key Insight 3: Need to Compare Memory Layouts Directly

Instead of trying to match parameters, we need to:
1. Dump the lm_head tensor from GPU memory
2. Compare with the GGUF file data byte-by-byte
3. Find where they differ

## Reverted Changes

Reverted to original `CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N` parameters to restore partial functionality.

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Verify Tensor Loading

**Test**: Check if lm_head is loaded correctly at problematic positions

```cpp
// Check position 63299 in GPU memory
half h_check[896];  // Full row
cudaMemcpy(h_check, lm_head_half + 63299, 896 * config_.vocab_size * sizeof(half), ...);

// Compare with GGUF file
// Read output.weight from GGUF at offset for token 63299
// Compare values
```

### Priority 2: Manual Dot Product Test

**Test**: Manually compute logits[63299] and compare with GEMM result

```cpp
float manual_logit = 0.0f;
for (int i = 0; i < 896; i++) {
    manual_logit += lm_head[63299 + i * vocab_size] * hidden[i];
}
fprintf(stderr, "Manual: %.4f, GEMM: %.4f\n", manual_logit, logits[63299]);
```

### Priority 3: Check llama.cpp Tensor Loading

**Action**: Look at how llama.cpp loads the output.weight tensor

```bash
cd reference/llama.cpp
grep -A 20 "output.weight" src/llama-model.cpp
```

Focus on:
- How it reads the tensor from GGUF
- Whether it transposes or reshapes it
- How it stores it in memory

## Status

- ‚ùå Fix attempt failed
- ‚úÖ Reverted to original code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Original bug still present (garbage at specific positions)
- üìã New investigation approach needed

## Files Modified

- `cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp` - Attempted fix, then reverted

## Conclusion

Changing the GEMM transpose parameters without fully understanding the memory layout made things catastrophically worse. We need a different approach:

1. **Don't guess at parameters** - Verify the actual memory layout first
2. **Test incrementally** - Check one position at a time
3. **Compare with GGUF data** - Verify tensor loading is correct

The answer is still in comparing with llama.cpp, but we need to focus on **how the tensor is loaded and stored in memory**, not just the GEMM parameters.
