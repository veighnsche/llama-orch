# CRITICAL FINDING - 2025-10-06 10:26

**UPDATE 2025-10-06 10:49**: ‚úÖ **ISSUE RESOLVED** - Matrix layout fix applied successfully.  
Q values now in correct range (0.01-0.26). See `TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md` for current status.  
**New issue**: Attention mechanism broken - outputs uniform across positions.

## llama.cpp vs Our Implementation

### Q Values (after scaling by 0.125)

**llama.cpp**:
```
-0.0150, -0.0101, -0.0150, -0.0101, -0.0150, -0.0101, -0.0150, -0.0101, 
-0.0407, -0.0699, -0.0407, -0.0699, -0.0407, -0.0699, -0.0407, -0.0699,
1.1328, -0.0076, 1.1328, -0.0076, 1.1328, -0.0076, 1.1328, -0.0076,
0.0541, -0.0629, 0.0541, -0.0629, 0.0541, -0.0629, 0.0541, -0.0629
```

**Our implementation** (from BUG_FIX_PROGRESS.md):
```
-0.2646, -0.0967, -0.1523, 0.0200, -13.3359, ...
```

### Attention Scores (Q¬∑K, already scaled)

**llama.cpp**:
```
pos=0: 147.31
pos=1: 146.89
pos=2: 147.25
```

**Our implementation**:
```
Scaled scores: ~125 (consistently)
```

## Analysis

### üî¥ HUGE DIFFERENCE IN Q VALUES

llama.cpp Q values: **~0.01 to 1.13** (reasonable range)  
Our Q values: **~0.02 to -13.34** (MASSIVE outliers!)

**Before scaling (multiply by 8):**
- llama.cpp: ~0.08 to 9.0
- Ours: ~0.16 to -106.7

### The Bug

We're loading Q values that are **10-100x larger** than llama.cpp!

This means:
1. ‚ùå Our QKV projection is wrong
2. ‚ùå Our weight loading is wrong
3. ‚ùå Our weight matrices have wrong values/dimensions

### Why Attention Scores Are Still Large

Even though our Q values are huge, the attention scores (~125 vs ~147) are similar because:
- K values might also be wrong
- The dot product partially cancels out
- But the DISTRIBUTION is wrong

## Next Steps

1. **Compare weight matrices** - Print first 10 values of `attn_q_weight`
2. **Check weight loading** - Verify dimensions, transpose, data type
3. **Check QKV projection** - Matrix multiplication might be wrong

## The Root Cause

The bug is NOT in attention mechanism itself. The bug is in:
- Weight loading from GGUF
- QKV projection computation
- Or pre-projection normalization

---

**This is the smoking gun!** llama.cpp's Q values are 10-100x smaller than ours.
