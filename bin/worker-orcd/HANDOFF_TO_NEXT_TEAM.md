# Handoff: Investigating the Repetitive Token Bug

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Previous root cause analysis was **incorrect**. The bug is **not** related to quantization. The true root cause is an unknown data corruption issue within the CUDA forward pass. The investigation needs to restart, focusing on the C++ code.

## To the Next Engineering Team

This document summarizes the investigation into a bug where the model generates the same token repeatedly. **The previous analysis was flawed.** The bug persists even when using a non-quantized FP16 model, invalidating the theory about a missing dequantization step.

**Your primary task is to debug the CUDA C++ forward pass to find the source of data corruption.** The problem lies in the final matrix multiplication that generates the logits.

---

## 1. The Bug

The model consistently generates the same token (e.g., "coholic", ID 44394) because the logits for certain tokens have abnormally high values (`~14.0-15.0`), which forces the `argmax` function to select them every time.

## 2. The Real Root Cause: Data Corruption in CUDA Forward Pass

The previous analysis blaming missing dequantization was **wrong**. The test `test_haiku_generation_stub_pipeline_only` uses an FP16 model, proving quantization is not the issue.

The actual problem is that the logit values are being corrupted during the final matrix multiplication step in the CUDA C++ code. The hidden state and weights going into the calculation are correct, but the output is garbage.

## 3. The "Fix" (Irrelevant)

The previously implemented changes in `gguf_dequant.rs` and `weight_loader.rs` are **not relevant** to this bug. They can be ignored or reverted.

## 4. The Roadblock: None

The previous theory about a build or caching issue was a red herring. The build system is working correctly; the problem is that the code itself is flawed.

## 5. Your Task: Debug the CUDA Forward Pass

Your task is to find the source of the data corruption in the CUDA C++ code.

1.  **Focus on `qwen_transformer.cpp`**: The primary file for investigation is `bin/worker-orcd/cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`.
2.  **Analyze the Final GEMM Call**: The bug likely lies in the `cublasGemmEx` call that computes the logits by multiplying the hidden state with the `lm_head` weights.
3.  **Add Debug Prints**: Add `printf` statements or use CUDA debugging utilities to inspect the contents of the hidden state tensor, the `lm_head` weight tensor, and the output logit tensor immediately before and after the `cublasGemmEx` call. This will help you pinpoint where the corruption occurs.
4.  **Compare with `llama.cpp`**: Refer to the `llama.cpp` implementation in the `reference/` directory to see a working example of the same matrix multiplication. Pay close attention to the parameters used for `cublasGemmEx`, especially the transpose flags (`CUBLAS_OP_N` vs `CUBLAS_OP_T`) and the matrix dimensions (m, n, k).
