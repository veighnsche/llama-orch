# GT-019: MHA vs GQA Differences Validation

**Team**: GPT-Gamma  
**Sprint**: Sprint 3 (MHA + Gate 1)  
**Size**: S (1 day)  
**Days**: 47  
**Spec Ref**: M0-W-1432

## Story Description

Document and validate the differences between MHA (Multi-Head Attention) used in GPT and GQA (Grouped Query Attention) used in Llama. Ensure both implementations are correct and optimized for their respective architectures.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation explains MHA vs GQA differences
- [ ] Test validates MHA has separate K/V per head
- [ ] Test validates GQA shares K/V across head groups
- [ ] Test compares memory usage (MHA > GQA)
- [ ] Test compares compute (MHA > GQA)
- [ ] Documentation updated with architecture comparison
- [ ] All validation tests passing

---

## Dependencies

### Upstream (Blocks This Story)
- GT-018: MHA Attention Decode (needs complete MHA)
- LT-016: GQA Attention Decode (needs complete GQA from Llama team)

### Downstream (This Story Blocks)
- GT-020: MHA Unit Tests (needs validated MHA)

---

## Technical Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- `bin/worker-orcd/docs/MHA_vs_GQA.md` - Architecture comparison
- `bin/worker-orcd/tests/validation/attention_comparison_test.cu` - Validation tests

---

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Tests
- Test MHA memory layout
- Test GQA memory layout
- Compare implementations

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
