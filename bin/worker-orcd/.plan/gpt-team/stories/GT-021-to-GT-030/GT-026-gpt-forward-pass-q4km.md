# GT-026: GPT Forward Pass (Q4_K_M)

**Team**: GPT-Gamma  
**Sprint**: Sprint 4 (GPT Basic)  
**Size**: L (3 days)  
**Days**: 63-65  
**Spec Ref**: M0-W-1434

## Story Description

Implement full GPT forward pass using Q4_K_M quantized weights. Orchestrate all GPT kernels (embeddings, LayerNorm, MHA, FFN, residual) to execute complete inference.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Forward pass executes all transformer layers
- [ ] Token + position embeddings applied
- [ ] LayerNorm â†’ MHA â†’ Residual â†’ LayerNorm â†’ FFN â†’ Residual per layer
- [ ] Final LayerNorm and LM head projection
- [ ] Sampling produces next token
- [ ] Unit tests validate forward pass correctness
- [ ] Integration test generates tokens
- [ ] Performance meets targets

---

## Dependencies

### Upstream (Blocks This Story)
- GT-025: GPT Weight Loading (needs loaded weights)
- GT-021: GPT Kernel Suite Integration (needs all kernels)

### Downstream (This Story Blocks)
- GT-027: GPT Basic Generation Test (needs working forward pass)

---

## Technical Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- `bin/worker-orcd/cuda/src/inference/gpt_forward.cpp` - Forward pass

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test single layer forward
- Test full model forward
- Test token generation

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
