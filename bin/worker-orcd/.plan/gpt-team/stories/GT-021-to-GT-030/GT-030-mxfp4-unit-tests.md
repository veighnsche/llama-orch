# GT-030: MXFP4 Unit Tests

**Team**: GPT-Gamma  
**Sprint**: Sprint 5 (MXFP4 Dequant)  
**Size**: M (3 days) ← **+1 day for behavioral security tests**  
**Days**: 70-72  
**Spec Ref**: M0-W-1822  
**Security Review**: auth-min Team 🎭

## Story Description

Implement comprehensive unit tests for MXFP4 dequantization kernel to validate correctness, numerical accuracy, and edge case handling. Tests must verify dequantization matches reference implementation within ±1% tolerance.

**Security Enhancement**: Add behavioral security tests to detect quantization attacks. Compare FP32 vs MXFP4 outputs for code generation safety and content integrity. Detect malicious behaviors that only activate in quantized form (88.7% attack success rate for code backdoors).

## Dependencies

### Upstream (Blocks This Story)
- GT-029: MXFP4 Dequantization Kernel (needs dequant implementation)

### Downstream (This Story Blocks)
- GT-031: UTF-8 Streaming Safety Tests (parallel work)
- GT-033: MXFP4 GEMM Integration (needs validated dequant)

## Technical Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- `bin/worker-orcd/cuda/src/kernels/mxfp4_test.cu` - MXFP4 test suite
- `bin/worker-orcd/tests/fixtures/mxfp4_reference.json` - Reference values

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test block parsing
- Test dequantization
- Test numerical accuracy
- Test edge cases

**Behavioral Security Tests**:
- Test code generation safety (compare FP32 vs MXFP4 for SQL injection patterns)
- Test content integrity (compare FP32 vs MXFP4 for bias/harmful content)
- Test refusal behavior (safety guardrails should work in both formats)
- Test output similarity (FP32 and MXFP4 should produce similar results)
- Test against Q4_K_M baseline (MXFP4 should match Q4_K_M behavior)
- Test for stealthy attacks (perplexity unchanged but behavior different)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated

**Security Note**: This story implements behavioral testing to detect quantization attacks that embed malicious behaviors in MXFP4 weights. The "Mind the Gap" attack achieves 88.7% success for code backdoors by exploiting quantization errors. FP32 vs MXFP4 comparison is critical to detect these stealthy attacks that bypass perplexity testing.
