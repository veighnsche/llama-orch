## Implementation Summary

**File**: `cuda/kernels/mxfp4_ffn.cu`

### Features Implemented
- **mxfp4_ffn_forward()** - Standard FFN with GELU activation
- **mxfp4_ffn_forward_bias()** - FFN with bias addition
- **mxfp4_swiglu_ffn_forward()** - SwiGLU variant with MXFP4
- **mxfp4_ffn_residual()** - FFN with residual connection
- **mxfp4_ffn_vram_savings()** - Calculate VRAM savings

### Implementation Details
- Up projection: input @ W_up^T with MXFP4 weights
- GELU activation on intermediate output
- Down projection: GELU(up) @ W_down^T with MXFP4 weights
- Supports SwiGLU variant (Swish gate + up projection)
- Integrated residual connections and LayerNorm

### Performance
- VRAM savings: ~4x for FFN weight matrices
- FFN typically largest weights in transformer (4x hidden_dim)
- Significant memory reduction for large models
