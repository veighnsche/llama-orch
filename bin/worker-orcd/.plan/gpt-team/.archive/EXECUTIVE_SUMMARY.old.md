## Why GPT Team Has Most Work

### 1. MXFP4 Complexity (20 days) - UNIQUE TO GPT

**No other team has this**:
- Dequantization kernel (4 days)
- Unit tests (2 days)
- GEMM integration (3 days)
- Wire into 5 weight consumers (9 days):
  - Embedding lookup
  - Attention Q/K/V projections
  - FFN up/down projections
  - LM head
- Numerical validation ¬±1% (3 days)

**Why it's hard**:
- Novel quantization format (no reference implementation)
- Must wire into ALL weight consumers
- FP16 accumulation paths required
- Numerical correctness critical

---

### 2. GPT-Specific Kernels (15 days) - MORE COMPLEX

**Comparison with Llama**:
- **LayerNorm** (6 days): Two reduction passes, learnable scale/bias
  - vs RMSNorm (1 day): Single reduction pass
- **MHA** (8 days): All heads have unique K/V
  - vs GQA (6 days): Grouped K/V heads
- **GELU** (2 days): Approximate formula
  - vs SwiGLU (2 days): Similar
- **Absolute Pos Emb** (1 day): Learned embeddings
  - vs RoPE (2 days): Rotary embeddings

**Total**: 15 days (GPT) vs 11 days (Llama)

---

### 3. Large Model Complexity (6 days) - UNIQUE TO GPT

**GPT-OSS-20B is 34x larger than Qwen**:
- Qwen: 352 MB ‚Üí ~400 MB VRAM
- GPT-OSS-20B: 12 GB ‚Üí ~16 GB VRAM

**Additional work**:
- 24 GB VRAM boundary tests (2 days)
- OOM recovery tests (2 days)
- UTF-8 multibyte edge cases (2 days)

**Llama team doesn't have this scale**.

---

### 4. HF Tokenizer (7 days) - DIFFERENT APPROACH

- HF tokenizers crate integration (1 day)
- tokenizer.json loading (2 days)
- Metadata exposure (2 days)
- Conformance tests (2 days)

**Comparison**: Llama has GGUF-BPE (9 days), similar complexity but different approach.

---

## The Bottlenecks

### Week 5: 19 Days of Work

**GPT Basic Pipeline** (9 days):
- Weight mapping (3 days)
- Weight loading (2 days)
- Forward pass (4 days)

**MXFP4 Dequantization** (6 days):
- Dequant kernel (4 days)
- Unit tests (2 days)

**Testing** (4 days):
- Generation tests (2 days)
- UTF-8 streaming (2 days)

**Why Critical**:
- Both work streams are critical path
- GPT basic needed for Gate 2
- MXFP4 dequant needed for Week 6
- Can't defer either

---

### Week 6: 17 Days of Work

**MXFP4 Integration** (15 days):
- GEMM integration (3 days)
- Embedding lookup (2 days)
- Attention Q/K/V (3 days)
- FFN up/down (2 days)
- LM head (2 days)
- Numerical validation (3 days)

**Adapter + End-to-End** (7 days):
- GPTInferenceAdapter (3 days)
- GPT-OSS-20B MXFP4 E2E (4 days)

**Why Critical**:
- MXFP4 wiring is sequential (must do in order)
- Numerical validation needs all components
- Gate 3 week (MXFP4 + Adapter)

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why does GPT Team need 4 people when Llama only needs 3?

**A**: MXFP4 complexity. GPT Team has 20 days of MXFP4 work that no other team has. This requires a dedicated Quantization Specialist.

### Q: Can we defer MXFP4 to M1?

**A**: No. GPT-OSS-20B with MXFP4 is an M0 requirement (3 models specified). Q4_K_M fallback exists but MXFP4 is the primary target.

### Q: Can we use Q4_K_M only for M0?

**A**: Technically yes, but violates M0 spec intent. GPT-OSS-20B is specifically chosen to validate MXFP4 path. Deferring defeats the purpose.

### Q: What if we can't get a Quantization Specialist?

**A**: Option B (3 people, 8 weeks) is acceptable. Same cost, but 2 weeks slower. Confidence drops to 75%.

### Q: How confident are you in the 4-person estimate?

**A**: 85% confident. The 4-person plan has 77% utilization with buffer time. Accounts for MXFP4 unknowns.

## Conclusion

**We have done our job**: Created comprehensive, granular planning for GPT Team.

**We found the hidden complexity**: GPT Team has **most work** of all 3 teams (92 days).

**Root cause**: MXFP4 (20 days) + large model (6 days) = 26 days more than Llama.

**We recommend**: **Add 4th team member (Quantization Specialist)** for 6-week timeline.

**Alternative**: If 4th person not available, extend to 8 weeks (Option B), but accept:
- 2-week delay to M0
- Lower confidence (75%)

**Decision required**: Project Manager + Stakeholders must choose before Week 2.

**We are ready**: Once decision made, GPT Team can start Week 2 immediately.
