# GPT Team Planning - Revision Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-04  
**Reason**: Revised for AI Agent Reality  
**Agent**: GPT-Gamma (Autonomous Development Agent)

---

## What Changed

### Before: Human Team Assumptions
- 2-4 people working in parallel
- "Weeks 5-6 SEVERELY overcommitted" (127%, 113% with 3 people)
- Need to "add 4th person" or "extend to 8 weeks"
- Concerns about "parallel work streams" and "team burnout"

### After: AI Agent Reality
- 1 autonomous agent working sequentially
- 92 agent-days starting day 15 = completes day 107
- No "overcommitment" - agent works until done
- No team scaling possible
- **GPT-Gamma is the CRITICAL PATH for M0**

---

## Files Updated

### 1. `docs/complete-story-list.md`
**Changes**:
- Header updated: "Agent: GPT-Gamma" instead of "2-4 people"
- Removed "Week X" labels, replaced with "Sprint X (N agent-days)"
- Added sequential execution notes
- Removed utilization percentages
- Added key milestones (Day 15 start, Day 74 MXFP4 dequant, Day 107 M0 delivery)
- Replaced "Planning Gap Analysis" with "Agent Execution Reality"
- Removed recommendations about team size
- Highlighted Day 107 as M0 CRITICAL PATH

**Key Addition**: Day 107 completion determines M0 delivery date

### 2. `docs/team-charter.md` (already updated by user)
**Changes**:
- Removed individual roles (C++ Lead, Quantization Specialist, Rust/C++ Dev, QA)
- Added "Team Profile" for GPT-Gamma agent
- Updated communication section (no standups, async only)
- Added agent capabilities and constraints
- Emphasized MXFP4 complexity handling

---

## Key Insights

### What We Got Wrong
1. **"Weeks 5-6 overcommitment"**: Meaningless for sequential agent - agent works until done
2. **"Need 4th person (Quantization Specialist)"**: Cannot scale agent count
3. **"Utilization"**: Not applicable to sequential execution
4. **"Parallel work streams"**: Agent works one story at a time (GPT basic ‚Üí MXFP4 dequant ‚Üí MXFP4 integration)

### What Actually Matters
1. **FFI Lock Timing**: Day 15 blocks GPT-Gamma start (15 days idle)
2. **Sequential MXFP4 Work**: 23 days of MXFP4 work (dequant + integration) must be done sequentially
3. **Critical Path**: GPT-Gamma (107 days) determines M0 delivery - longest of all agents
4. **Novel Implementation**: MXFP4 has no reference implementation - needs validation framework
5. **Q4_K_M Baseline**: Must establish GPT working with Q4_K_M before tackling MXFP4

## Timeline Reality

**GPT-Gamma**: 92 agent-days starting day 15 (sequential)
- Sprint 1 (Days 15-26): HF Tokenizer + GPT Metadata
- Sprint 2 (Days 27-41): GPT Kernels Foundation
- Sprint 3 (Days 42-55): MHA Attention + Gate 1
- Sprint 4 (Days 56-66): GPT Basic Pipeline + **Gate 2** üî¥
- Sprint 5 (Days 67-74): MXFP4 Dequantization üî¥ **NOVEL FORMAT**
- Sprint 6 (Days 75-89): MXFP4 Integration üî¥ **CRITICAL**
- Sprint 7 (Days 90-96): Adapter + E2E + **Gate 3** üî¥
- Sprint 8 (Days 97-107): Final Integration + **M0 DELIVERY** üî¥

**Completion**: Day 107 (15 + 92) ‚Üê **M0 CRITICAL PATH**

## Why GPT-Gamma Has Most Work

### 1. MXFP4 Complexity (20 days) - UNIQUE TO GPT

**No other agent has this**:
- Novel quantization format (microscaling FP4)
- No reference implementation
- Dequantization kernel (4 days)
- Unit tests (2 days)
- Wire into 5 weight consumers sequentially (12 days)
- Numerical validation ¬±1% (3 days)

### 2. Large Model Complexity (6 days) - UNIQUE TO GPT

**GPT-OSS-20B is 34x larger than Qwen**:
- 12 GB model (vs Qwen 352 MB)
- ~16 GB VRAM total (close to 24 GB limit)
- OOM recovery tests (2 days)
- 24 GB boundary tests (2 days)
- UTF-8 multibyte edge cases (2 days)

### 3. GPT Kernels More Complex (4 days more than Llama)

- LayerNorm (6 days) vs RMSNorm (1 day) - two reduction passes
- MHA (8 days) vs GQA (6 days) - all heads unique K/V

**Total Unique Work**: 20 + 6 = **26 days more than Llama-Beta**

**This is why GPT-Gamma is the critical path**

## Critical Dependencies

### Upstream (Blocking GPT-Gamma)
1. **Day 15**: Foundation-Alpha must lock FFI interface
   - **Blocks**: GPT-Gamma cannot start until this
   - **Impact**: 15 days idle time

2. **Day 52**: Foundation-Alpha must complete integration framework
   - **Blocks**: Gate 1 validation
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate kernels without test framework

3. **Day 71**: Foundation-Alpha must complete adapter pattern
   - **Blocks**: Gate 3 validation
   - **Impact**: Cannot implement GPTInferenceAdapter

### Internal (GPT-Gamma's own dependencies)
1. **Day 26**: HF tokenizer blocks GPT basic
2. **Day 55**: Kernels block GPT basic
3. **Day 66**: GPT basic (Q4_K_M) blocks MXFP4 work
4. **Day 74**: MXFP4 dequant blocks integration
5. **Day 89**: MXFP4 integration blocks adapter

**All sequential - no parallelization possible**

## Action Items

### For GPT-Gamma
1. ‚úÖ Wait for FFI lock (day 15)
2. üìö Study MXFP4 spec during wait time (days 1-14)
3. üß™ Design MXFP4 validation framework before implementation
4. üéØ Establish Q4_K_M baseline first (Sprint 4)
5. ü§ñ Begin GT-001 immediately when FFI locked

### For Project Manager (Vince)
1. ‚úÖ Accept 107-day timeline for M0 (GPT-Gamma critical path)
2. ‚úÖ Coordinate FFI lock timing with Foundation-Alpha
3. ‚úÖ Update consolidated findings to reflect Day 107 M0 delivery
4. ‚úÖ Communicate realistic timeline to stakeholders

---

## M0 Delivery Reality

**Critical Path**: GPT-Gamma (107 days total)
- Foundation-Alpha: 87 days (finishes day 87)
- Llama-Beta: 87 days (finishes day 87, starts day 15)
- GPT-Gamma: 107 days (finishes day 107, starts day 15) ‚Üê **DETERMINES M0**

**M0 Delivery Date**: **Day 107** (GPT-Gamma finishes last)

**This is ~21 weeks, not 8 weeks**

---

## What's Next

**Immediate**: Update consolidated findings document to reflect:
- M0 delivery driven by GPT-Gamma (day 107)
- All three agents work in parallel (different monitors)
- Sequential execution within each agent
- FFI lock at day 15 is critical coordination point

**Status**: ‚úÖ GPT Team Revised  
**Critical Path**: GPT-Gamma determines M0 timeline  
**M0 Delivery**: Day 107
