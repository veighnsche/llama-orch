# Gate 3: MXFP4 + Adapter Complete

**Day**: 96  
**Participants**: GPT-Gamma, Foundation-Alpha (adapter coordination)  
**Purpose**: Validate MXFP4 quantization and GPTInferenceAdapter work end-to-end

---

## Gate Overview

Gate 3 validates that MXFP4 quantization is fully integrated and the GPTInferenceAdapter follows the architecture adapter pattern. This proves GPT-OSS-20B can fit in 24GB VRAM with MXFP4 and integrates correctly with the architecture detection system.

Passing Gate 3 means M0 is nearly complete, with only final testing and documentation remaining.

## Validation Procedure

### Step 1: Load GPT-OSS-20B with MXFP4
```bash
cargo run --bin worker-orcd -- \
  --worker-id test-gpt-mxfp4 \
  --model /path/to/gpt-oss-20b-mxfp4.gguf \
  --gpu-device 0 \
  --port 8080
```

**Expected Output**: Model loads, architecture detected as GPT  
**Pass Criteria**: Worker ready, VRAM usage <24GB

### Step 2: Verify Architecture Detection
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Expected Output**: `{"architecture": "GPT", "quant_kind": "MXFP4"}`  
**Pass Criteria**: Correct architecture and quantization reported

### Step 3: Generate Text with MXFP4
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "The future of AI", "max_tokens": 100}'
```

**Expected Output**: Coherent text generation  
**Pass Criteria**: Quality comparable to Q4_K_M

### Step 4: Verify Numerical Accuracy
```bash
cargo test --package worker-orcd --test mxfp4_accuracy
```

**Expected Output**: Accuracy within ±1%  
**Pass Criteria**: All accuracy tests passing

### Fail
If ANY checklist item is ❌ unchecked:

**Action if Fail**:
1. Identify root cause
2. Create fix stories
3. Block Sprint 8 work
4. Re-run Gate 3 after fixes
