# Gate 1: GPT Kernels Complete

**Day**: 53  
**Participants**: GPT-Gamma  
**Purpose**: Validate all GPT-specific CUDA kernels are implemented, tested, and ready for model loading

---

## Gate Overview

Gate 1 validates that all GPT-specific kernels are complete and working correctly. This includes LayerNorm, GELU, MHA attention, FFN, and residual connections. These kernels differentiate GPT architecture from Llama and are foundational for all subsequent work.

Passing Gate 1 means the GPT team can proceed with model loading and inference integration.

## Validation Procedure

### Step 1: Run Unit Test Suite
```bash
cd bin/worker-orcd
cargo test --package worker-orcd --lib gpt_kernels
```

**Expected Output**: All tests passing  
**Pass Criteria**: 100% test pass rate

### Step 2: Run Integration Tests
```bash
cargo test --package worker-orcd --test gpt_kernel_integration
```

**Expected Output**: Full transformer layer executes  
**Pass Criteria**: Integration tests passing

### Step 3: Verify Performance
```bash
cargo bench --package worker-orcd --bench gpt_kernels
```

**Expected Output**: Performance metrics within targets  
**Pass Criteria**: All kernels meet performance targets

### Step 4: Review Documentation
```bash
ls bin/worker-orcd/docs/kernels/gpt/
```

**Expected Output**: Documentation files present  
**Pass Criteria**: All kernels documented

## Pass/Fail Criteria

### Pass
All checklist items must be ✅ checked.

**Action if Pass**:
- Mark Gate 1 as complete in master-timeline.md
- Proceed to Sprint 4 (GPT Basic)
- Notify Foundation team (Gate 1 coordination)

### Fail
If ANY checklist item is ❌ unchecked:

**Action if Fail**:
1. Identify root cause of failure
2. Create fix stories (GT-XXX-fix)
3. Block Sprint 4 work
4. Re-run Gate 1 validation after fixes

---

## Deliverables

- [ ] Gate 1 validation report (this document with all boxes checked)
- [ ] Kernel performance benchmark results
- [ ] Updated master-timeline.md

---

## Dependencies

### Blocks
- Sprint 4: GPT Basic (needs validated kernels)
- GT-024: GPT Weight Mapping (needs kernel suite)
