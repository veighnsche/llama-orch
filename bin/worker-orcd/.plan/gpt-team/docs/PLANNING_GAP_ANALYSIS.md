## Detailed Analysis

### Work Breakdown by Team Size

#### Scenario A: 2 People (COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE)

| Week | Stories | Estimated Days | Available Days | Utilization | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 2 | 7 | 12 | 10 | 120% | üî¥ Overcommitted |
| 3 | 8 | 15 | 10 | 150% | üî¥ Overcommitted |
| 4 | 7 | 14 | 10 | 140% | üî¥ Overcommitted |
| 5 | 10 | 19 | 10 | **190%** | üî¥ **SEVERELY Overcommitted** |
| 6 | 9 | 17 | 10 | 170% | üî¥ Overcommitted |
| 7 | 7 | 15 | 10 | 150% | üî¥ Overcommitted |

**Total**: 48 stories, 92 days of work, 60 days available (2 people √ó 6 weeks √ó 5 days)

**Overall Utilization**: 92 / 60 = **153%** üî¥ **COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE**

**Every single week is overcommitted.** This is not a viable option.

---

#### Scenario B: 3 People (OVERCOMMITTED)

| Week | Stories | Estimated Days | Available Days | Utilization | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 2 | 7 | 12 | 15 | 80% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 3 | 8 | 15 | 15 | 100% | üü° Tight |
| 4 | 7 | 14 | 15 | 93% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 5 | 10 | 19 | 15 | **127%** | üî¥ **Overcommitted** |
| 6 | 9 | 17 | 15 | **113%** | üî¥ **Overcommitted** |
| 7 | 7 | 15 | 15 | 100% | üü° Tight |

**Total**: 48 stories, 92 days of work, 90 days available (3 people √ó 6 weeks √ó 5 days)

**Overall Utilization**: 92 / 90 = **102%** üî¥ **OVERCOMMITTED**

**Weeks 5-6 are critical bottlenecks.** High risk of gate failures.

---

#### Scenario C: 4 People (FEASIBLE) ‚≠ê

| Week | Stories | Estimated Days | Available Days | Utilization | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 2 | 7 | 12 | 20 | 60% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 3 | 8 | 15 | 20 | 75% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 4 | 7 | 14 | 20 | 70% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 5 | 10 | 19 | 20 | 95% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 6 | 9 | 17 | 20 | 85% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 7 | 7 | 15 | 20 | 75% | ‚úÖ Good |

**Total**: 48 stories, 92 days of work, 120 days available (4 people √ó 6 weeks √ó 5 days)

**Overall Utilization**: 92 / 120 = **77%** ‚úÖ **HEALTHY**

**All weeks are sustainable.** This is the recommended option.

## Critical Finding: Week 5 Bottleneck

### The Problem

**Week 5 Committed Work** (19 days):

**GPT Basic Pipeline** (9 days):
- GT-024: GPT Weight Mapping (3 days)
- GT-025: GPT Weight Loading (2 days)
- GT-026: GPT Forward Pass (4 days)

**MXFP4 Dequantization** (6 days):
- GT-029: MXFP4 Dequant Kernel (4 days)
- GT-030: MXFP4 Unit Tests (2 days)

**Testing** (4 days):
- GT-027: GPT Basic Generation Test (2 days)
- GT-028: UTF-8 Streaming Tests (2 days)

**Total**: 19 days

**Week 5 Available Capacity**:
- 2 people: 10 days ‚Üí **190% utilization** üî¥
- 3 people: 15 days ‚Üí **127% utilization** üî¥
- 4 people: 20 days ‚Üí **95% utilization** ‚úÖ

### Why This Is Critical

1. **Both Work Streams Are Critical Path**:
   - GPT basic needed for Gate 2 (Week 5)
   - MXFP4 dequant needed for Week 6 integration
   - Can't defer either

2. **Limited Parallelization**:
   - GPT forward pass (4 days) is single-threaded work
   - MXFP4 dequant (4 days) is single-threaded work
   - With 3 people, one person idle while others blocked

3. **Gate 2 Risk**:
   - Week 5 slip ‚Üí Gate 2 failure ‚Üí M0 delayed
   - MXFP4 slip ‚Üí Week 6 (Gate 3) at risk

4. **No Buffer**:
   - Zero slack time for bugs, rework, or learning curve
   - Any issue cascades to Week 6

---

## Critical Finding: Week 6 Bottleneck

### The Problem

**Week 6 Committed Work** (17 days):

**MXFP4 Integration** (15 days):
- GT-033: MXFP4 GEMM Integration (3 days)
- GT-034: MXFP4 Embedding Lookup (2 days)
- GT-035: MXFP4 Attention (Q/K/V) (3 days)
- GT-036: MXFP4 FFN (Up/Down) (2 days)
- GT-037: MXFP4 LM Head (2 days)
- GT-038: MXFP4 Numerical Validation (3 days)

**Adapter + Integration** (7 days):
- GT-039: GPTInferenceAdapter (3 days)
- GT-040: GPT-OSS-20B MXFP4 End-to-End (4 days)

**Total**: 17 days (some overlap in GT-040)

**Week 6 Available Capacity**:
- 2 people: 10 days ‚Üí **170% utilization** üî¥
- 3 people: 15 days ‚Üí **113% utilization** üî¥
- 4 people: 20 days ‚Üí **85% utilization** ‚úÖ

### Why This Is Critical

1. **MXFP4 Wiring Is Sequential**:
   - Must wire into embedding, then attention, then FFN, then LM head
   - Each depends on previous (numerical validation needs all)
   - Limited parallelization

2. **Numerical Validation Is Complex**:
   - Compare MXFP4 vs Q4_K_M baseline
   - ¬±1% tolerance across all layers
   - Debugging numerical issues time-consuming

3. **Gate 3 Risk**:
   - Week 6 is Gate 3 week (MXFP4 + Adapter)
   - Slip ‚Üí M0 delivery at risk

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why GPT Team Has Most Work

#### 1. MXFP4 Complexity (20 days total)

**No other team has this**:
- Dequantization kernel (4 days)
- Unit tests (2 days)
- GEMM integration (3 days)
- Wire into 5 weight consumers (9 days):
  - Embedding lookup (2 days)
  - Attention Q/K/V (3 days)
  - FFN up/down (2 days)
  - LM head (2 days)
- Numerical validation (3 days)

**Why it's hard**:
- Novel quantization format (no reference implementation)
- Must wire into ALL weight consumers
- FP16 accumulation paths required
- Numerical correctness critical (¬±1% tolerance)

**Comparison**:
- Foundation Team: No quantization work
- Llama Team: No quantization work (Q4_K_M is standard)
- GPT Team: **20 days of MXFP4 work**

---

#### 2. GPT-Specific Kernels (15 days)

**More complex than Llama kernels**:
- **LayerNorm** (6 days): Two reduction passes (mean + variance), learnable scale/bias
  - vs Llama's RMSNorm (1 day): Single reduction pass
- **MHA** (8 days): All heads have unique K/V, more memory
  - vs Llama's GQA (6 days): Grouped K/V heads, less memory
- **GELU** (2 days): Approximate formula with tanh
  - vs Llama's SwiGLU (2 days): Similar complexity
- **Absolute Pos Emb** (1 day): Learned embeddings
  - vs Llama's RoPE (2 days): Rotary embeddings

**Total**: 15 days (GPT) vs 11 days (Llama kernels)

---

#### 3. Large Model Complexity (6 days)

**GPT-OSS-20B is 34x larger than Qwen**:
- Qwen: 352 MB ‚Üí ~400 MB VRAM
- Phi-3: 2.3 GB ‚Üí ~3.5 GB VRAM
- GPT-OSS-20B: 12 GB ‚Üí ~16 GB VRAM

**Additional work**:
- 24 GB VRAM boundary tests (2 days)
- OOM recovery tests (2 days)
- UTF-8 multibyte edge cases (2 days)
- Memory profiling (implicit in stories)

**Llama team doesn't have this scale**.

---

#### 4. HF Tokenizer (7 days)

**Different from GGUF-BPE**:
- HF tokenizers crate integration (1 day)
- tokenizer.json loading (2 days)
- Metadata exposure (2 days)
- Conformance tests (2 days)

**Comparison**:
- Llama Team: GGUF-BPE (9 days) - pure Rust implementation
- GPT Team: HF tokenizer (7 days) - crate integration

**Similar complexity, different approach**.

---

### Total Unique Work

| Category | Days | Unique to GPT? |
|----------|------|----------------|
| MXFP4 | 20 | ‚úÖ YES |
| GPT Kernels | 15 | Partially (4 days more than Llama) |
| Large Model | 6 | ‚úÖ YES |
| HF Tokenizer | 7 | Different approach (vs GGUF-BPE) |
| **Total Unique** | **26 days** | **More than Llama** |

**This is why GPT Team needs 4 people (vs Llama's 3).**
