# Team Documentation Parity Status

**Date**: 2025-10-04 02:19  
**Purpose**: Track documentation parity between Foundation and GPT teams

---

## Overview

Both teams need equivalent documentation structure. GPT team (GPT-Gamma) has created a comprehensive set of planning artifacts. Foundation team (Foundation-Alpha) needs to match this structure.

## Action Items

### Immediate (High Priority)
- [ ] Create execution/day-tracker.md
- [ ] Create execution/dependencies.md
- [ ] Update gate-1-week-4.md ‚Üí gate-1-foundation-complete.md

### Soon (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create execution/milestones.md
- [ ] Create sprint-2-ffi-layer/README.md
- [ ] Create sprint-3-shared-kernels/README.md
- [ ] Create sprint-4-integration-gate1/README.md

### Later (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Create remaining sprint READMEs (5-7)
- [ ] Create remaining gate checklists (2-4)
- [ ] Create execution/vram-enforcement-framework.md

## Rationale for Parity

**Why match GPT team structure?**

1. **Consistency**: Both teams should have equivalent planning artifacts
2. **Handoff**: Engineers need same structure across teams
3. **Tracking**: Uniform tracking enables cross-team coordination
4. **Completeness**: Comprehensive planning reduces execution risk

**What's different between teams?**

- **Sprint count**: GPT has 9 sprints (includes prep), Foundation has 7
- **Gate count**: Foundation has 4 gates (includes M0), GPT has 3
- **Specific validation**: Each team has unique validation framework
  - GPT: MXFP4 numerical validation
  - Foundation: VRAM-only enforcement validation

---

## Timeline

**Current Status**: Foundation team has story cards complete, supporting docs 20% complete

**Target**: Complete parity by end of PM planning phase

**Estimated Effort**:
- Sprint READMEs: ~2 hours (7 docs √ó 15 min each)
- Gate checklists: ~1 hour (4 docs √ó 15 min each)
- Execution docs: ~1 hour (4 docs √ó 15 min each)
- **Total**: ~4 hours to achieve full parity

---

## Summary

**Foundation Team Status**:
- ‚úÖ Story cards: 100% complete (49/49)
- ‚úÖ Core docs: 100% complete (5/5)
- ‚úÖ Narration: 100% integrated (40+ stories)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sprint READMEs: 14% complete (1/7)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gate checklists: 25% complete (1/4)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Execution docs: 0% complete (0/4)

**Overall Completion**: 65% (31/48 artifacts)

**Remaining Work**: 15 documents to achieve full parity with GPT team
