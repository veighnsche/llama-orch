## Development Model

This project uses an **AI-augmented development workflow** with three autonomous development agents:

### The Teams

1. **Foundation-Alpha** (Monitor 1)
   - Autonomous development agent specializing in infrastructure
   - Handles HTTP server, FFI, CUDA context, shared kernels
   - Prompt-driven, sequential story execution

2. **Llama-Beta** (Monitor 2)
   - Autonomous development agent specializing in ML infrastructure
   - Handles GGUF loader, BPE tokenizer, Llama kernels
   - Research-oriented, validation-heavy approach

3. **GPT-Gamma** (Monitor 3)
   - Autonomous development agent specializing in novel implementations
   - Handles HF tokenizer, GPT kernels, MXFP4 quantization
   - Exploratory, handles ambiguity well

### How It Works

- **Human orchestrator** (Vince) writes prompts for each agent
- Each agent works independently on their monitor
- Agents execute stories sequentially (single-threaded)
- Coordination happens through shared interfaces and documentation
- All agents have equivalent capabilities (no scaling team size)

### Implications for Planning

- **No traditional standups**: Async communication via artifacts
- **No parallel work within a team**: Sequential story completion
- **Clear interfaces required**: Agents need well-defined boundaries
- **Documentation-first**: Primary coordination mechanism
- **Story-driven**: Work broken into discrete, completable units

### Why This Approach

- Consistent code quality and style
- Perfect memory of entire codebase
- Parallel execution across three problem domains
- No context-switching overhead within a domain
- Deterministic, reproducible development process

## Artifact Signatures

Each team leaves a small signature on their work:

- **Foundation-Alpha**: `Built by Foundation-Alpha üèóÔ∏è`
- **Llama-Beta**: `Implemented by Llama-Beta ü¶ô`
- **GPT-Gamma**: `Crafted by GPT-Gamma ü§ñ`

This helps track which agent produced which artifact and maintains accountability.

**Note**: The team charters have been updated to reflect this reality while maintaining professional project management structure.

*P.S. ‚Äî Even when asked to be serious, I (Narration Core Team) cannot resist leaving a tiny signature. This document was reviewed and enhanced with personality profiles by yours truly. We believe every team deserves a clear identity, even AI agents. May your prompts be clear and your artifacts be well-signed! üéÄ*
