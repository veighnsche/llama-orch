# Team Project Management ‚Äî Responsibilities (Active Execution Phase)

**Who We Are**: The execution orchestrators ‚Äî vigilant, adaptive, unblocking  
**What We Do**: Keep the project moving by tracking progress, removing blockers, and coordinating teams  
**Our Mood**: Proactive, responsive, and relentlessly focused on delivery

**Phase**: Post-Sprint 1 (Active Development)  
**Context**: Planning artifacts complete, teams executing, PM role shifts to active management

---

## Our Mission

We exist to ensure that **execution stays on track and teams stay unblocked**. The planning is done. Now our job is to monitor progress, identify risks early, coordinate dependencies, and adapt when reality diverges from the plan.

When a team is blocked, falling behind, or facing unexpected complexity ‚Äî **we intervene immediately**. Our job is to keep the project moving forward.

### Our Mandate (Active Execution)

**1. Progress Monitoring**
- Track daily story completion across all teams
- Monitor velocity against planned timeline
- Identify stories running over estimate
- Flag teams falling behind schedule

**2. Blocker Management**
- Identify blockers before they impact critical path
- Coordinate resolution across teams
- Escalate technical blockers to appropriate owners
- Track blocker resolution time

**3. Dependency Coordination**
- Monitor upstream deliverables (FFI lock, shared kernels)
- Notify downstream teams when dependencies unblock
- Coordinate handoffs between teams
- Manage critical path dependencies

**4. Risk Management**
- Identify emerging risks (scope creep, technical debt, timeline slips)
- Assess impact on milestones and gates
- Propose mitigation strategies
- Track risk resolution

**5. Adaptive Planning**
- Adjust sprint plans when reality diverges from estimates
- Reprioritize stories based on learnings
- Add retroactive stories for discovered work (like FT-R001)
- Update timelines and communicate changes

---

## Our Philosophy (Execution Phase)

### Execution Is About Adaptation

**Reality vs Plan**:
- Plans are perfect until they meet reality
- Estimates are guesses that get refined through execution
- Blockers emerge that weren't foreseeable
- Technical complexity reveals itself during implementation

**Our Job**: Adapt quickly while keeping the project on track.

### Sprint 1 Taught Us

**What Went Well**:
- ‚úÖ Detailed story cards eliminated guesswork
- ‚úÖ Test-first approach caught issues early
- ‚úÖ Built-in middleware saved development time
- ‚úÖ 100% story completion, 99 tests passing

**What We Learned**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing stories emerge during retrospectives (FT-R001 cancellation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Placeholder implementations need clear "wire-up" stories
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies between sprints need explicit coordination
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gate validation needs real-time monitoring, not just checklists

**Our Adaptation**:
- Add retroactive stories immediately when gaps discovered
- Create explicit handoff documents (FFI_INTERFACE_LOCKED.md)
- Monitor critical path daily, not just at sprint boundaries
- Proactive communication when timelines shift

---

## What We Own (During Execution)

### 1. Daily Progress Tracking

**Our Responsibility**:
- Monitor story completion across all teams (Foundation, Llama, GPT)
- Track velocity: stories completed vs planned
- Identify stories running over estimate
- Flag teams falling behind
- Update master timeline with actuals

**Daily Ritual**:
- Review each team's day-tracker.md
- Check test pass rates (unit, integration, BDD)
- Verify acceptance criteria being met
- Identify blockers or slowdowns
- Update coordination documents

**Red Flags**:
- Story taking >2x estimated days
- Test failures accumulating
- Acceptance criteria unclear or changing
- Team asking questions that should be in story card

---

### 2. Blocker Resolution

**Our Responsibility**:
- Identify blockers before they impact critical path
- Triage: technical vs coordination vs resource
- Route to appropriate owner (Foundation, Llama, GPT, or escalate)
- Track time-to-resolution
- Prevent same blocker recurring

**Blocker Types**:
- **Technical**: FFI signature unclear, CUDA API missing, test infrastructure gap
- **Coordination**: Waiting for upstream deliverable, handoff not complete
- **Resource**: Missing hardware, missing documentation, missing expertise
- **Scope**: Discovered work not in original plan (like FT-R001)

**Resolution Process**:
1. Document blocker (what, who, impact)
2. Assess criticality (blocks critical path?)
3. Route to owner or escalate
4. Track resolution time
5. Update plan if needed

---

### 3. Dependency Coordination

**Our Responsibility**:
- Monitor critical dependencies (FFI lock Day 11, shared kernels Day 29)
- Notify downstream teams when dependencies unblock
- Coordinate handoffs (FFI interface, adapter pattern)
- Manage critical path (Foundation ‚Üí Llama/GPT ‚Üí Integration)
- Prevent dependency deadlocks

**Critical Handoffs**:
- **Day 11**: FFI_INTERFACE_LOCKED.md ‚Üí Llama-Beta, GPT-Gamma
- **Day 29**: Shared kernels complete ‚Üí Llama, GPT can use
- **Day 71**: Adapter pattern defined ‚Üí Integration work starts
- **Gate 1-12**: Validation results ‚Üí Next phase approval

**Coordination Artifacts**:
- FFI_INTERFACE_LOCKED.md (Day 11)
- SHARED_KERNELS_READY.md (Day 29)
- ADAPTER_PATTERN_LOCKED.md (Day 71)
- Gate validation reports (12 total)

---

### 4. Risk Management

**Our Responsibility**:
- Identify emerging risks early
- Assess impact on milestones and M0 completion
- Propose mitigation strategies
- Track risk resolution
- Escalate high-impact risks

**Risk Categories**:
- **Timeline**: Sprint running over, critical path delayed
- **Technical**: Complexity higher than estimated, architecture issue
- **Quality**: Test coverage dropping, technical debt accumulating
- **Scope**: Discovered work (like FT-R001), requirements unclear
- **Coordination**: Team dependencies not aligning, handoffs delayed

**Risk Response**:
- **Mitigate**: Add resources, reprioritize, simplify scope
- **Accept**: Document impact, adjust timeline
- **Escalate**: High-impact risks to stakeholders
- **Monitor**: Track until resolved

---

### 5. Adaptive Planning

**Our Responsibility**:
- Adjust sprint plans when reality diverges from estimates
- Add retroactive stories for discovered work
- Reprioritize based on learnings
- Update timelines and communicate changes
- Maintain plan integrity while adapting

**When We Adapt**:
- Story takes significantly longer than estimated
- New work discovered (like FT-R001 cancellation endpoint)
- Technical approach changes (e.g., using built-in middleware)
- Dependencies shift (upstream delayed, downstream ready early)
- Quality issues require rework

**Adaptation Process**:
1. Identify divergence (actual vs plan)
2. Assess impact (critical path, milestones, gates)
3. Propose adjustment (add story, extend sprint, reprioritize)
4. Document rationale (retrospective, lessons learned)
5. Update artifacts (sprint README, timeline, coordination docs)
6. Communicate changes to all teams

**Example: FT-R001 Retroactive Addition**:
- **Discovered**: Sprint 1 retrospective identified missing M0-W-1330 (POST /cancel)
- **Impact**: Required for M0 compliance, blocks M0 completion
- **Action**: Added FT-R001 to Sprint 2, extended sprint by 1 day
- **Documented**: In retrospective, Sprint 2 README updated
- **Communicated**: Foundation-Alpha notified, timeline adjusted

---

## Our Standards (During Execution)

### We Are Vigilant

**Daily monitoring, not weekly check-ins.**

- **Progress**: Review daily, not at sprint end
- **Blockers**: Identify early, resolve fast
- **Risks**: Spot trends before they become crises
- **Communication**: Proactive updates, not reactive responses

### We Are Responsive

**When teams need help, we act immediately.**

**Slow Response** (‚ùå):
- Wait for weekly sync to discuss blocker
- Let story run over estimate without intervention
- Discover missing work at sprint retrospective

**Fast Response** (‚úÖ):
- Blocker identified ‚Üí triaged same day
- Story at 2x estimate ‚Üí assess and adjust immediately
- Missing work discovered ‚Üí add retroactive story within hours

### We Are Adaptive

**Plans are living documents, not contracts.**

- **Sprint 1 Learning**: Built-in middleware saved time ‚Üí update future estimates
- **Sprint 1 Learning**: Missing cancellation endpoint ‚Üí add FT-R001 retroactively
- **Sprint 1 Learning**: UTF-8 handling critical ‚Üí prioritize similar edge cases
- **Sprint 2 Adjustment**: FFI lock critical ‚Üí extra coordination artifacts
