## Detailed Analysis

### Work Breakdown

| Week | Stories | Estimated Days | Available Days | Utilization | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 5 | 9 | 15 | 60% | ‚úÖ Healthy |
| 2 | 7 | 13 | 15 | 87% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 3 | 8 | 14 | 15 | 93% | ‚úÖ Good |
| 4 | 7 | 14 | 15 | 93% | ‚úÖ Good (Gate 1) |
| 5 | 5 | 8 | 15 | 53% | üü° Underutilized |
| 6 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 73% | ‚úÖ Good (Gate 3) |
| 7 | 9 | 16 | 15 | **107%** | üî¥ **OVERCOMMITTED** |

**Total**: 47 stories, 85 days of work, 105 days available (7 weeks √ó 3 people √ó 5 days)

**Overall Utilization**: 85 / 105 = 81% (would be healthy if evenly distributed)

## Critical Finding: Week 7 Overcommitment

### The Problem

**Week 7 Committed Work**:
- FT-039: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (4 days)
- FT-040: Performance Baseline Measurements (2 days)
- FT-041: All Models Integration Test (3 days)
- FT-042: OOM Recovery Test (2 days)
- FT-043: UTF-8 Streaming Edge Cases Test (2 days)
- FT-044: Cancellation Integration Test (2 days)
- FT-045: Documentation Complete (1 day)
- **Total**: 16 days

**Week 7 Available Capacity**: 15 days (3 people √ó 5 days)

**Overcommitment**: 16 - 15 = **1 day (7% over)**

### Why This Is Critical

1. **Gate 4 Risk**: Week 7 is Gate 4 week (M0 completion). Overcommitment = high risk of gate failure.

2. **No Buffer**: Zero slack time for:
   - Unexpected bugs
   - Integration issues
   - Rework from code review
   - Team member unavailability

3. **Burnout Risk**: 107% utilization is not sustainable, especially in final week.

4. **Cascading Delays**: If Week 7 slips, entire M0 delivery delayed.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Week 7 Is Overloaded

**Reason 1: CI/CD Deferred**
- CI/CD (4 days) was pushed to Week 7 to keep earlier weeks manageable
- But CI/CD is critical path work, can't be skipped

**Reason 2: Final Integration Complexity**
- All 3 models must work (Qwen, Phi-3, GPT)
- Multiple edge case tests (OOM, UTF-8, cancellation)
- Documentation finalization
- All happening in parallel

**Reason 3: Optimistic Estimates**
- Assumed no rework needed
- Assumed no bugs from Week 6 integration
- Assumed perfect execution

---

## Options Analysis

### Option A: Extend to 8 Weeks ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**Changes**:
- Move FT-039 (CI/CD, 4 days) to Week 6
- Move FT-040 (Performance baseline, 2 days) to Week 6
- Week 7 becomes 10 days (67% utilization)
- Add Week 8 as buffer (5 days, 33% utilization)

**New Timeline**:
| Week | Days | Util % | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1-4 | As planned | 60-93% | Foundation + Gate 1 |
| 5 | 8 | 53% | Support role |
| 6 | 17 | **113%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Still overcommitted |
| 7 | 10 | 67% | Integration + testing |
| 8 | 5 | 33% | Buffer + Gate 4 |

**Wait, Week 6 now overcommitted!**

**Revised Option A**:
- Start CI/CD in Week 5 (use slack time)
- Split CI/CD across Weeks 5-6 (2 days each week)
- Performance baseline in Week 6 (2 days)

**Final Timeline**:
| Week | Days | Util % | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1-4 | As planned | 60-93% | Foundation + Gate 1 |
| 5 | 10 | 67% | Support + CI/CD start |
| 6 | 15 | 100% | CI/CD finish + Perf + Adapter |
| 7 | 10 | 67% | Integration + testing |
| 8 | 5 | 33% | Buffer + Gate 4 |

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ No overcommitment
- ‚úÖ Buffer time for unknowns
- ‚úÖ Lower risk of gate failures
- ‚úÖ Sustainable pace

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå 1 extra week (8 weeks total)
- ‚ùå Higher cost (1 week √ó 3 people)

**Risk**: LOW

---

### Option B: Reduce Scope

**Changes**:
- Make CI/CD optional (manual testing for M0)
- Defer performance baseline to M1
- Reduce edge case testing (only critical tests)

**New Week 7**:
- FT-041: All Models Integration Test (3 days)
- FT-042: OOM Recovery Test (2 days)
- FT-043: UTF-8 Streaming Test (2 days)
- FT-044: Cancellation Test (2 days)
- FT-045: Documentation (1 day)
- **Total**: 10 days (67% utilization)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Stays within 7 weeks
- ‚úÖ No additional cost

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Lower quality M0 (no CI/CD)
- ‚ùå Manual testing burden
- ‚ùå Technical debt (CI/CD needed for M1 anyway)
- ‚ùå Performance baseline unknown

**Risk**: MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### Option C: Add 4th Developer for Week 7

**Changes**:
- Bring in 4th developer for Week 7 only
- Week 7 capacity becomes 20 days
- 16 days / 20 days = 80% utilization

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Stays within 7 weeks
- ‚úÖ All work completed

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Onboarding overhead (new developer needs context)
- ‚ùå Additional cost
- ‚ùå May not be available (hiring/allocation)
- ‚ùå Coordination overhead

**Risk**: MEDIUM

---

### Option D: Work Overtime in Week 7

**Changes**:
- Team works extra hours in Week 7
- 1 day overtime = 16 days fits in 15 days

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Stays within 7 weeks
- ‚úÖ No additional cost

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Burnout risk
- ‚ùå Quality suffers under pressure
- ‚ùå Unsustainable practice
- ‚ùå Team morale impact

**Risk**: HIGH

---

## Recommendation

### **Choose Option A: Extend to 8 Weeks**

**Rationale**:
1. **Lowest Risk**: No overcommitment, buffer time for unknowns
2. **Sustainable**: Healthy utilization (67-100%)
3. **Quality**: Time for proper CI/CD, testing, documentation
4. **Realistic**: Accounts for real-world issues (bugs, rework, learning)

**Cost**: 1 extra week (3 people √ó 1 week = 3 person-weeks)

**Benefit**: 
- Higher confidence in M0 delivery
- Lower stress on team
- Better quality output
- Proper CI/CD from day 1

**Alternative**: If 8 weeks absolutely not acceptable, choose Option B (reduce scope), but accept technical debt.

---

## Secondary Finding: Week 5 Underutilization

### The Opportunity

**Week 5 Utilization**: 53% (8 days committed, 15 days available)

**Slack Time**: 7 days

**Why This Exists**:
- Week 5 is "support role" for Teams 2 & 3
- Intentionally light to provide flexibility
- Buffer for unexpected issues from Gate 1

### Recommendation

**Use Week 5 Slack Strategically**:
1. ‚úÖ Start CI/CD setup (2 days)
2. ‚úÖ Prepare adapter interface design (1 day)
3. ‚úÖ Write API documentation draft (1 day)
4. ‚úÖ Keep 3 days as true buffer

**Revised Week 5**: 12 days (80% utilization)

**Benefit**: Reduces Week 6-7 pressure

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path

```
Week 1: HTTP Server
  ‚Üì (2 days)
Week 2: FFI Interface ‚Üê **LOCK POINT**
  ‚Üì (1 week)
Week 3: Shared Kernels
  ‚Üì (1 week)
Week 4: Integration + Gate 1 ‚Üê **CRITICAL MILESTONE**
  ‚Üì (1 week)
Week 5: Support Teams 2 & 3
  ‚Üì (1 week)
Week 6: Adapter Pattern + Gate 3
  ‚Üì (1 week)
Week 7: Final Integration
  ‚Üì (1 week)
Week 8: Buffer + Gate 4 ‚Üê **M0 COMPLETE**
```

**Critical Path Duration**: 8 weeks (with Option A)

**Slack Time**: 
- Week 1: 6 days
- Week 5: 7 days (reduced to 3 days if we use slack)
- Week 8: 10 days (buffer week)
- **Total**: 19 days of slack

**Analysis**: With 19 days of slack in an 8-week timeline, we can absorb significant delays and still deliver M0.

## Financial Impact

### 7-Week Timeline (Risky)

**Cost**: 7 weeks √ó 3 people = 21 person-weeks

**Risk Cost** (if Gate 4 fails):
- 1-2 weeks delay = 3-6 person-weeks
- Rework cost = 2-4 person-weeks
- **Total Risk**: 5-10 person-weeks

**Expected Cost**: 21 + (0.5 probability √ó 7.5 average) = **24.75 person-weeks**

### 8-Week Timeline (Safe)

**Cost**: 8 weeks √ó 3 people = 24 person-weeks

**Risk Cost** (much lower):
- Gate failure probability: 10% (vs 50%)
- Expected delay: 0.5 weeks (vs 1.5 weeks)
- **Total Risk**: 0.15 person-weeks

**Expected Cost**: 24 + 0.15 = **24.15 person-weeks**

### Conclusion

**8-week timeline is actually CHEAPER** when accounting for risk!
