## Planning Gap Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FINDING: Week 7 Overcommitted**

**Problem**: Week 7 has 16 days of work committed but only 15 days available (107% utilization).

**Impact**: 
- Risk of Gate 4 failure
- M0 delivery delayed
- Team burnout

**Options**:

#### Option A: Extend to 8 Weeks (Recommended)
- Move FT-039 (CI/CD) to Week 6 (can start earlier)
- Move FT-040 (Performance baseline) to Week 6
- Week 7 becomes 12 days (80% utilization)
- **Total timeline**: 8 weeks instead of 7

#### Option B: Reduce Scope
- Make CI/CD optional (manual testing for M0)
- Defer performance baseline to M1
- Week 7 becomes 10 days (67% utilization)
- **Risk**: Lower quality M0

#### Option C: Add Developer
- Add 4th developer for Week 7 only
- Week 7 capacity becomes 20 days
- 16 days / 20 days = 80% utilization
- **Cost**: Additional resource

### üü° **MEDIUM FINDING: Week 5 Underutilized**

**Observation**: Week 5 only 53% utilized (support role)

**Opportunity**: 
- Pull forward some Week 6 work (API docs, adapter design prep)
- Start CI/CD setup early
- More buffer for unexpected issues

**Recommendation**: Use Week 5 slack time as buffer, don't add more work

### üü¢ **POSITIVE: Weeks 2-4 Well Balanced**

**Observation**: Weeks 2-4 are 87-93% utilized

**Analysis**: Good balance, leaves room for:
- Unexpected bugs
- Integration issues
- Learning curve

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path

```
Week 1: HTTP Server (FT-001)
  ‚Üì
Week 1: Execute Endpoint (FT-002)
  ‚Üì
Week 2: FFI Interface (FT-006, FT-007)
  ‚Üì
Week 2: CUDA Context (FT-010)
  ‚Üì
Week 3: Shared Kernels (FT-015, FT-016, FT-017, FT-018)
  ‚Üì
Week 4: Integration Tests (FT-023, FT-024)
  ‚Üì
Week 4: **GATE 1** (FT-027) ‚Üê CRITICAL MILESTONE
  ‚Üì
Week 5: Support Teams 2 & 3 (FT-028, FT-029)
  ‚Üì
Week 6: Adapter Pattern (FT-033, FT-034)
  ‚Üì
Week 6: **GATE 3** (FT-038)
  ‚Üì
Week 7: Final Integration (FT-041)
  ‚Üì
Week 7: **GATE 4** (FT-047) ‚Üê M0 COMPLETE
```

**Critical Path Duration**: 7 weeks (minimum)

**Slack Time**: 
- Week 1: 6 days slack (60% util)
- Week 5: 7 days slack (53% util)
- **Total slack**: 13 days

**Analysis**: With 13 days of slack, we can absorb some delays, but Week 7 overcommitment is still a risk.

## Risk Register

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| FFI interface changes after Week 2 | Blocks Teams 2 & 3 | Medium | Lock interface by Week 2 end, no changes |
| Gate 1 failure (Week 4) | Entire project delayed | Low | Weekly integration tests, early detection |
| Week 7 overcommitment | Gate 4 failure, M0 delay | **HIGH** | **Extend to 8 weeks (Option A)** |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| CUDA context bugs | Integration delays | Medium | Valgrind tests, VRAM tracking from day 1 |
| SSE UTF-8 edge cases | Client-facing bugs | Medium | Comprehensive test vectors, fuzzing |
| KV cache complexity | Week 4 delays | Medium | Start early (Week 3 if possible) |

---

## Recommendations

### 1. **Extend Timeline to 8 Weeks** (Critical)

**Rationale**: Week 7 is overcommitted (107%). This is not sustainable.

**Action**:
- Move FT-039 (CI/CD) to Week 6
- Move FT-040 (Performance baseline) to Week 6
- Week 7 becomes focused on final integration and bug fixes

**New Timeline**:
- Weeks 1-6: As planned
- Week 7: Integration + testing (12 days, 80% util)
- Week 8: Buffer + Gate 4 (if needed)

### 2. **Lock FFI Interface by Week 2 End** (Critical)

**Rationale**: Any changes after Week 2 block Teams 2 & 3.

**Action**:
- FT-006 (FFI interface) must be reviewed by all teams
- Sign-off meeting Friday Week 2
- Document in `interfaces.md` with "LOCKED" status

### 3. **Start CI/CD in Week 5** (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Week 5 has slack time (53% util), CI/CD is on critical path.

**Action**:
- Move FT-039 (CI/CD) from Week 7 to Week 5-6 (split across 2 weeks)
- Reduces Week 7 pressure

### 4. **Add Integration Tests Early** (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Catch issues before Gate 1.

**Action**:
- Add smoke test in Week 2 (HTTP ‚Üí FFI ‚Üí CUDA context init)
- Don't wait until Week 4 for first integration test

## Revised Timeline (8 Weeks)

| Week | Stories | Days | Util % | Gate |
|------|---------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | 5 | 9 | 60% | - |
| 2 | 7 | 13 | 87% | - |
| 3 | 8 | 14 | 93% | - |
| 4 | 7 | 14 | 93% | Gate 1 ‚úì |
| 5 | 5 + CI start | 11 | 73% | Gate 2 ‚úì |
| 6 | 6 + CI + Perf | 15 | 100% | Gate 3 ‚úì |
| 7 | 6 (integration) | 12 | 80% | - |
| 8 | 3 (buffer + Gate 4) | 5 | 33% | Gate 4 ‚úì |

**Total**: 8 weeks, 93 days of work, 120 days available (3 people √ó 8 weeks √ó 5 days)

**Utilization**: 93 / 120 = 78% (healthy for project with unknowns)

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Review this analysis with team leads
2. **Immediate**: Decide on 7 weeks (risky) vs 8 weeks (recommended)
3. **Week 0**: Create all 47 story cards in `stories/backlog/`
4. **Week 0**: Story sizing workshop (validate estimates)
5. **Week 1**: Sprint planning, commit to first 5 stories

**Status**: ‚úÖ Analysis Complete  
**Recommendation**: **Extend to 8 weeks**  
**Next Action**: Stakeholder decision on timeline
