# Sprint 1: HTTP Foundation

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Days**: 1-9 (9 agent-days)  
**Goal**: Establish HTTP server with SSE streaming and request handling foundation

---

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 1 is the foundational sprint that establishes the HTTP layer for worker-orcd. This sprint has no external dependencies and can begin immediately. It creates the Axum-based HTTP server with SSE streaming, correlation ID middleware, and request validation framework.

This sprint provides the entry point for all inference requests and establishes patterns that will be used throughout the project.

## Story Execution Order

### Day 1: FT-001 - HTTP Server Setup
**Goal**: Initialize Axum HTTP server with basic health endpoint  
**Key Deliverable**: Running HTTP server with /health endpoint  
**Blocks**: FT-002 (POST /execute endpoint)

### Days 2-3: FT-002 - POST /execute Endpoint Skeleton
**Goal**: Create POST /execute endpoint structure  
**Key Deliverable**: Endpoint that accepts requests and returns placeholder responses  
**Blocks**: FT-003 (SSE streaming)

### Days 4-5: FT-003 - SSE Streaming Implementation
**Goal**: Implement Server-Sent Events streaming for token delivery  
**Key Deliverable**: Working SSE stream with proper event formatting  
**Blocks**: FT-004 (correlation ID middleware)

### Day 6: FT-004 - Correlation ID Middleware
**Goal**: Add correlation ID middleware for request tracing  
**Key Deliverable**: All requests tagged with correlation IDs  
**Blocks**: FT-005 (request validation)

### Days 7-8: FT-005 - Request Validation Framework
**Goal**: Implement request validation with detailed error messages  
**Key Deliverable**: Comprehensive validation for all request fields  
**Blocks**: Sprint 2 (FFI layer)

## Dependencies

### Upstream (Blocks This Sprint)
- None (first sprint, no dependencies)

### Downstream (This Sprint Blocks)
- Sprint 2: FFI Layer (needs HTTP foundation)
- FT-006: FFI Interface Definition (needs request/response types)

## Success Criteria

Sprint is complete when:
- [ ] All 5 stories marked complete
- [ ] HTTP server running and accepting requests
- [ ] /health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] POST /execute endpoint accepts requests
- [ ] SSE streaming working with proper event format
- [ ] Correlation ID middleware operational
- [ ] Request validation framework complete
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Ready for Sprint 2 (FFI layer)
