## ‚úÖ What Went Right

### 1. **Spec-First Approach Worked Perfectly**
- Each ticket had clear acceptance criteria from specs
- No ambiguity about what to build
- Testing requirements pre-defined by Testing Team
- **Lesson**: Continue spec-first for all future sprints

### 2. **Built-In Middleware Saved Time**
- Used `observability_narration_core::axum::correlation_middleware`
- Zero custom middleware code needed
- 3 tests already written in narration-core
- **Lesson**: Check for existing solutions in shared crates before building custom

### 3. **Test-Driven Development Caught Issues Early**
- UTF-8 buffer tests caught boundary issues immediately
- Integration tests validated end-to-end flows
- Property tests covered edge cases
- **Lesson**: Write tests BEFORE or DURING implementation, not after

### 4. **Incremental Delivery Enabled Fast Iteration**
- Each story built on previous (FT-001 ‚Üí FT-002 ‚Üí FT-003 ‚Üí FT-004 ‚Üí FT-005)
- Dependencies clearly defined
- No blocking issues
- **Lesson**: Maintain clear dependency chains in future sprints

### 5. **Narration Integration Was Seamless**
- v0.2.0 builder pattern made it easy
- Correlation IDs propagated automatically
- All events properly structured
- **Lesson**: Narration-core v0.2.0 is production-ready

### 6. **Validation Framework Evolution**
- Started with single-error validation (FT-002)
- Enhanced to multi-error collection (FT-005)
- Backward compatible (both methods available)
- **Lesson**: Build minimal first, enhance based on requirements

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Went Wrong / Could Be Improved

### 1. **Over-Engineering: Unused Code**

**Problem**: Several modules have unused code that will sit idle until Sprint 2+

**Unused Items**:
- `Utf8Buffer` - Created but not wired to streaming yet (will be used in FT-006)
- `InferenceEvent::Metrics` - Defined but never emitted (metrics in Sprint 3)
- `InferenceEvent::Error` - Defined but never emitted (error handling in Sprint 2)
- `error_codes::*` - All 5 error codes defined but unused
- `AppState.worker_id` and `AppState.model` - Not accessed yet
- `HttpServer::shutdown()` and `HttpServer::addr()` - Not called yet
- `WorkerError` enum - Entire error module unused
- `ValidationError.validate()` - Superseded by `validate_all()` but kept for compatibility

**Impact**: 
- Code bloat (27 warnings in build)
- Maintenance burden for unused code
- Unclear what's actually needed vs speculative

**Lesson for Future**: 
- ‚ùå **DON'T** build infrastructure "just in case"
- ‚úÖ **DO** build only what's needed for current story
- ‚úÖ **DO** add features when they're actually required
- ‚úÖ **DO** delete unused code aggressively (per destructive-actions.md)

**Action Items**:
- Consider removing `validate()` method (only use `validate_all()`)
- Remove error_codes module until FT-006 needs it
- Remove WorkerError enum until error handling story
- Remove Utf8Buffer until streaming integration story

### 2. **Test File Organization Could Be Better**

**Problem**: Integration test files have unused imports and helper functions

**Examples**:
- `create_test_router()` defined but never used (3 files)
- Unused imports: `Request`, `StatusCode`, `Body`, `tower::ServiceExt`
- Copy-paste between test files

**Impact**:
- 9 warnings about unused code in tests
- Harder to maintain
- Unclear which helpers are actually needed

**Lesson for Future**:
- ‚úÖ Clean up unused imports immediately
- ‚úÖ Extract common test helpers to shared module
- ‚úÖ Run `cargo fix` to auto-remove unused imports
- ‚ùå Don't copy-paste test scaffolding

**Action Items**:
- Create `tests/common/mod.rs` for shared test utilities
- Run `cargo fix --tests` to clean up imports
- Remove unused `create_test_router()` functions

### 3. **Validation Has Two APIs (Confusing)**

**Problem**: Both `validate()` and `validate_all()` exist

**Why This Happened**:
- FT-002 implemented `validate()` (first error only)
- FT-005 added `validate_all()` (all errors)
- Kept both for "backward compatibility"

**Impact**:
- Confusing API surface (which one to use?)
- `validate()` is never actually used in execute.rs
- Extra code to maintain

**Lesson for Future**:
- ‚ùå **DON'T** keep unused methods for "compatibility" in new code
- ‚úÖ **DO** replace old implementation with new one
- ‚úÖ **DO** have ONE way to do things (Zen of Python)

**Action Items**:
- Remove `validate()` method entirely
- Rename `validate_all()` to `validate()`
- Update execute.rs to use single method

### 4. **Missing Feature Flag for Debug Narration**

**Problem**: Tried to use `emit_debug()` but it requires `debug-enabled` feature

**Why This Happened**:
- Spec suggested using `emit_debug()` for validation success
- Feature not enabled in Cargo.toml
- Had to remove the debug narration

**Impact**:
- Lost debug-level validation success events
- Less granular observability

**Lesson for Future**:
- ‚úÖ Check feature flags before using optional APIs
- ‚úÖ Enable features when needed (not speculatively)
- ‚úÖ Document which features are required

**Action Items**:
- Decide if debug narration is needed
- If yes, enable `debug-enabled` feature
- If no, remove from specs

---

## üéØ Key Learnings for Future Sprints

### 1. **Build Minimal, Extend When Needed**
- ‚úÖ UTF-8 buffer is ready but unused ‚Üí Good (will be used in FT-006)
- ‚ùå Error codes defined but unused ‚Üí Bad (should wait until needed)
- ‚ùå Metrics event defined but unused ‚Üí Bad (should wait until Sprint 3)

**Rule**: Only build what the CURRENT story needs, not what FUTURE stories might need.

### 2. **One Way To Do Things**
- ‚ùå Two validation methods (`validate()` + `validate_all()`)
- ‚ùå Two error types (`ValidationError` + `ValidationErrorResponse`)

**Rule**: Prefer single, comprehensive solution over multiple partial solutions.

### 3. **Clean As You Go**
- ‚úÖ Tests passing (good)
- ‚ùå 27 warnings about unused code (bad)
- ‚ùå Unused imports in test files (bad)

**Rule**: Run `cargo fix` and `cargo clippy` after each story. Zero warnings policy.

### 4. **Test Organization Matters**
- ‚úÖ Separate integration test files per concern (good)
- ‚ùå Duplicate test helpers across files (bad)
- ‚ùå Unused helper functions (bad)

**Rule**: Extract common test utilities to `tests/common/mod.rs` immediately.

### 5. **Narration Integration Was Easy**
- ‚úÖ Built-in middleware worked perfectly
- ‚úÖ Builder pattern is intuitive
- ‚úÖ Correlation IDs propagate automatically

**Rule**: Narration-core v0.2.0 is production-ready. Use it everywhere.

## üöÄ Sprint 2 Preparation

### Technical Debt to Address FIRST

Before starting Sprint 2 stories, clean up:

1. **Remove unused validation method**
   ```rust
   // DELETE: validate() method (unused)
   // KEEP: validate_all() and rename to validate()
   ```

2. **Clean up test imports**
   ```bash
   cargo fix --tests --allow-dirty
   ```

3. **Remove speculative code**
   ```rust
   // DELETE: error_codes module (until FT-006 needs it)
   // DELETE: WorkerError enum (until error handling story)
   // DELETE: InferenceEvent::Metrics (until Sprint 3)
   // DELETE: InferenceEvent::Error (until FT-006 needs it)
   ```

4. **Extract common test utilities**
   ```rust
   // CREATE: tests/common/mod.rs
   // MOVE: Shared test helpers
   ```

### Story Order for Sprint 2

Based on Sprint 1 learnings:

1. **FT-006**: FFI Integration (CUDA wrapper)
   - Build ONLY what's needed for FFI boundary
   - Wire Utf8Buffer to token streaming
   - Add error codes when actually needed
   - Add InferenceEvent::Error when actually needed

2. **FT-007**: Model Loading
   - Build on FT-006 FFI wrapper
   - Use AppState.model field (currently unused)

3. **FT-008**: Inference Execution
   - Wire everything together
   - Replace placeholder SSE stream with real CUDA tokens

---

## üí° Insights & Patterns

### Pattern: Spec ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Clean

**What Worked**:
1. Read spec thoroughly
2. Write tests based on acceptance criteria
3. Implement code to pass tests
4. Clean up warnings immediately

**What Didn't Work**:
1. Skipping cleanup step (accumulated 27 warnings)
2. Building features before they're needed

### Pattern: Shared Crates First

**What Worked**:
- Using narration-core's built-in middleware (FT-004)
- Zero custom code, just wiring

**What Didn't Work**:
- Not checking if Utf8Buffer already exists in shared crates
- Could have been in a shared `streaming-utils` crate

### Pattern: Backward Compatibility in New Code

**What Didn't Work**:
- Keeping `validate()` for "compatibility" when nothing uses it
- Two error types when one would suffice

**Lesson**: In v0.1.0, there's NO backward compatibility to maintain. Be aggressive about simplification.

## üìù Recommendations for Future Foundation-Alpha

### For Sprint 2 (CUDA Integration)

**DO**:
- Clean up Sprint 1 technical debt FIRST
- Build minimal FFI wrapper (FT-006)
- Wire Utf8Buffer when actually streaming tokens
- Add error handling when errors actually occur
- Test CUDA integration thoroughly

**DON'T**:
- Add CUDA features not in the story
- Build "nice to have" monitoring before it's needed
- Keep unused code "just in case"
- Accumulate warnings

### For Sprint 3 (Metrics & Observability)

**DO**:
- Add `InferenceEvent::Metrics` when metrics story starts
- Wire metrics emission to actual CUDA stats
- Build metrics only for what's specified

**DON'T**:
- Add metrics in Sprint 2 "to prepare"
- Build metrics dashboard before metrics exist
- Over-engineer metrics collection

### General Principles

1. **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
   - Don't build it until a story requires it
   - Delete it if it's unused
   - Trust that you can add it later

2. **Zero Warnings Policy**
   - Fix warnings immediately
   - Don't accumulate technical debt
   - Clean code = maintainable code

3. **One Way To Do Things**
   - Single validation method
   - Single error type
   - No "compatibility" in v0.1.0

4. **Shared Crates First**
   - Check narration-core
   - Check other shared crates
   - Build custom only when necessary

5. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Tests during implementation
   - Property tests for edge cases
   - Integration tests for flows

---

## üîÆ Predictions for Sprint 2

### What Will Go Well

1. **FFI Integration** - Clear boundary, well-specified
2. **Token Streaming** - Utf8Buffer already built and tested
3. **Error Handling** - Can add error codes when needed

### What Might Be Challenging

1. **CUDA Mocking** - Need good test doubles for CUDA calls
2. **Memory Management** - FFI boundary requires careful ownership
3. **Performance** - First time measuring actual inference latency

### Risks to Watch

1. **Over-Engineering** - Temptation to add "nice to have" CUDA features
2. **Test Coverage** - CUDA code harder to test than HTTP
3. **Error Handling** - Many failure modes in CUDA layer

## üìö Knowledge Captured

### What We Learned About worker-orcd

1. **Architecture**: HTTP ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí SSE ‚Üí (Future: CUDA)
2. **Error Handling**: Multi-error validation with structured responses
3. **Observability**: Correlation IDs + narration everywhere
4. **Testing**: 99 tests covering all paths

### What We Learned About Axum

1. **Middleware**: `middleware::from_fn()` is simple and powerful
2. **Extractors**: `Extension<String>` for middleware data
3. **SSE**: `Sse::new(stream)` with `Event::default().event().json_data()`
4. **Error Responses**: `IntoResponse` trait for custom errors

### What We Learned About Testing

1. **Property Tests**: Great for validation edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Essential for end-to-end flows
3. **Test Organization**: Separate files per concern
4. **Common Helpers**: Extract to avoid duplication

---

## üé¨ Closing Thoughts

Sprint 1 was a **success** - all 5 stories delivered, 99 tests passing, zero failures. The HTTP foundation is solid and ready for CUDA integration.

However, we **over-engineered** in places:
- Built features before they were needed (error codes, metrics events)
- Kept unused code for "compatibility" (dual validation API)
- Accumulated warnings instead of cleaning immediately

For Sprint 2, we'll be more disciplined:
- **Build minimal** - only what the story needs
- **Clean immediately** - zero warnings after each story
- **Delete aggressively** - unused code goes away
- **One way** - single API for each concern

The foundation is strong. Now let's build the CUDA layer on top of it.
