# Sprint Plan: Week 1 - HTTP Foundation

**Team**: Foundation  
**Sprint Dates**: [TBD - Monday to Friday]  
**Sprint Goal**: Establish HTTP server with basic endpoints and SSE streaming

---

## Committed Stories

| Story ID | Title | Size | Owner | Status |
|----------|-------|------|-------|--------|
| FT-001 | HTTP Server Setup | M (2d) | Rust Lead | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started |
| FT-002 | POST /execute Endpoint (Skeleton) | M (2d) | Rust Lead | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started |
| FT-003 | SSE Streaming Infrastructure | M (3d) | Rust Lead | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started |
| FT-004 | Correlation ID Middleware | S (1d) | Rust Lead | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started |
| FT-005 | Request Validation Framework | S (1d) | Rust Lead | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started |

**Total Committed**: 9 days  
**Team Capacity**: 15 days (3 people √ó 5 days)  
**Utilization**: 60% (intentionally light for first sprint)

---

## Sprint Capacity

- **Team Size**: 3 developers (Rust Lead, C++ Lead, DevOps)
- **Available Days**: 15 days total
- **Holidays/PTO**: None planned
- **Buffer**: 6 days (40%) for unknowns, setup, learning

---

## Sprint Objectives

### Primary Objectives (Must Have)
1. ‚úÖ HTTP server running and responding to requests
2. ‚úÖ POST /execute accepts and validates requests
3. ‚úÖ SSE streaming infrastructure working

### Secondary Objectives (Nice to Have)
4. ‚≠ê Correlation ID middleware
5. ‚≠ê Request validation framework

### Stretch Goals
- Start FFI interface design (prep for Week 2)
- Set up development environment docs

---

## Dependencies

### Upstream (Blocking Us)
- None (first sprint)

### Downstream (We Block)
- Week 2 FFI work depends on HTTP server being stable
- Teams 2 & 3 waiting for HTTP API to be defined

---

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| üü° Rust Lead unavailable | High | C++ Lead can help with Rust (cross-training) |
| üü° Axum learning curve | Medium | Allocate extra time for first stories |
| üü¢ SSE complexity | Medium | Start with simple implementation, iterate |

## Definition of Done (Sprint Level)

- [ ] All committed stories moved to "Done"
- [ ] HTTP server can be started and stopped
- [ ] POST /execute returns 202 for valid requests
- [ ] SSE streaming sends events in correct order
- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] No compiler warnings
- [ ] Demo successful (shown to team)
- [ ] Retrospective complete

---

## Integration Checkpoints

### Mid-Sprint (Wednesday)
- [ ] FT-001 complete (HTTP server running)
- [ ] FT-002 in progress (execute endpoint)
- [ ] No blockers

### End-Sprint (Friday)
- [ ] All 5 stories complete
- [ ] Integration test: HTTP ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí SSE response
- [ ] Ready for Week 2 (FFI work)

## Notes

**First Sprint Considerations**:
- Intentionally light (60% util) to account for:
  - Team formation
  - Development environment setup
  - Learning curve (Axum, SSE)
  - Process establishment (standups, demos)
  
**Success Criteria**:
- Not about velocity, about establishing foundation
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Build team rhythm

**Handoff to Week 2**:
- HTTP server stable and documented
- API contracts defined
- Ready for FFI interface work

---

**Status**: üìã Ready for Sprint Planning  
**Next Action**: Monday sprint planning meeting
