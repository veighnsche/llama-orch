## M0 Success Criteria

M0 is complete when worker-orcd can:

1. **Load Models**: Load Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-OSS-20B from GGUF files
2. **Generate Tokens**: Generate tokens for both models with correct tokenization
3. **Stream Results**: Stream tokens via SSE with proper UTF-8 handling
4. **VRAM Enforcement**: Enforce VRAM-only allocation (no RAM fallback)
5. **Determinism**: Produce reproducible results with seeded RNG
6. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully across all layers
7. **Architecture Detection**: Automatically detect and select correct adapter
8. **Performance**: Meet performance baselines for token generation
9. **Testing**: Pass all unit, integration, and edge case tests
10. **Documentation**: Provide complete documentation for users and developers

**Anti-Cheat Validation**: Generate a haiku using Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with seed=42 and verify exact token sequence matches expected output (FT-050).

## Next Steps

**Post-M0 Work**:
- Performance optimization (reduce latency, increase throughput)
- Additional model support (Llama-3.x, Mistral, etc.)
- Advanced features (speculative decoding, quantization awareness)
- Production hardening (monitoring, alerting, observability)
