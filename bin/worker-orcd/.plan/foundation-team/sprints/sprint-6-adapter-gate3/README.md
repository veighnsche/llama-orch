# Sprint 6: Adapter + Gate 3

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Days**: 61-71 (11 agent-days)  
**Goal**: Implement adapter pattern, achieve Gate 2 and Gate 3 checkpoints

---

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 6 implements the InferenceAdapter pattern that provides a unified interface for both Llama and GPT architectures. This sprint includes two critical gates: **Gate 2 on Day 62** (both architectures working) and **Gate 3 on Day 71** (adapter pattern complete).

The adapter pattern enables polymorphic model handling and architecture detection, completing the Foundation layer's architectural design.
