# Sprint 5: Support + Prep

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Days**: 53-60 (8 agent-days)  
**Goal**: Support Llama/GPT integration, fix bugs, prepare for adapter pattern

---

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 5 is a support and preparation sprint. With Gate 1 complete, the Foundation team now supports Llama-Beta and GPT-Gamma as they integrate with the Foundation layer. This sprint also includes bug fixes and preparation for the adapter pattern work in Sprint 6.

This sprint is collaborative, with Foundation-Alpha responding to integration issues discovered by the other teams.
