# Sprint 5: Execution Order

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Sprint**: Support + Prep  
**Days**: 53-60 (8 agent-days)  
**Status**: üìã Ready for execution

---

## Sprint Philosophy

Sprint 5 is a **support and preparation sprint**. Unlike previous sprints with concrete deliverables, this sprint is **reactive** - we respond to integration issues from Llama-Beta and GPT-Gamma teams while proactively preparing for Sprint 6.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Llama/GPT teams drive the agenda** - we respond to their needs
2. **Proactive tasks fill gaps** - when not supporting, we prepare
3. **Documentation is critical** - capture patterns and solutions
4. **Quality over speed** - fix issues thoroughly, not quickly

- Answer adapter pattern questions

**Proactive Activities** (Priority 2):
- [ ] Document adapter pattern usage (`docs/ADAPTER_PATTERN_GUIDE.md`)
- [ ] Add Llama-specific integration tests
- [ ] Validate FFI error handling
- [ ] Create Llama integration checklist

**Daily Standup**:
- Any blocking issues from Llama team?
- Any FFI questions or clarifications needed?
- Any integration test failures?
- What proactive tasks completed?

**End-of-Day Deliverable**:
- Llama team unblocked
- All reported issues resolved or tracked
- Proactive tasks progressed

## Coordination Protocol

### Communication Channels

**Daily Updates**:
- Update `execution/day-tracker.md` with:
  - Current story
  - Support activities performed
  - Proactive tasks completed
  - Blockers encountered

**Issue Tracking**:
- Log integration issues in `execution/dependencies.md`
- Track bug fixes in story TODO files
- Document patterns in completion summaries

**Team Coordination**:
- Monitor Llama team progress (check their day-tracker)
- Monitor GPT team progress (check their day-tracker)
- Respond to questions in shared docs
- Update master timeline

### Decision Framework

**When to prioritize reactive vs proactive work**:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Team reports blocking issue | Drop everything, fix immediately |
| Team asks clarifying question | Respond within 1 hour |
| Team reports non-blocking bug | Track, fix within 1 day |
| No active support requests | Work on proactive tasks |
| Unclear priority | Ask team for priority |
