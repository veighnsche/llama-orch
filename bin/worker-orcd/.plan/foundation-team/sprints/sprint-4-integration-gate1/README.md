# Sprint 4: Integration + Gate 1

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Days**: 39-52 (14 agent-days)  
**Goal**: Implement KV cache, create integration test framework, achieve Gate 1 checkpoint

---

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 4 completes the Foundation layer by implementing KV cache management and creating a comprehensive integration test framework. This sprint culminates in **Gate 1 on Day 52**, which validates that the entire Foundation layer (HTTP + FFI + CUDA) works end-to-end.

Gate 1 is a critical milestone that blocks Llama and GPT teams from proceeding to their Gate 1 validations.
