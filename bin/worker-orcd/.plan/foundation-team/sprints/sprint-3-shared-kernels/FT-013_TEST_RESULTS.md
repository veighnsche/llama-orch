## Test Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Core RAII Functionality (6 tests)
- **Allocation**: Memory allocated successfully with non-null pointer
- **Deallocation**: Memory freed automatically in destructor
- **Move Constructor**: Ownership transferred correctly
- **Move Assignment**: Ownership transferred, old memory freed
- **Self-Assignment**: No-op when moving to self
- **Zero Bytes**: Throws error for invalid allocation

### ✅ Aligned Allocation (5 tests)
- **Basic Alignment**: Returns pointer aligned to 256 bytes
- **Various Alignments**: 64, 128, 256 byte alignments all work
- **Non-Power-of-2**: Throws error for invalid alignment
- **Zero Alignment**: Throws error for zero alignment
- **Size Rounding**: Rounds up size to alignment boundary

### ✅ Zero Initialization (3 tests)
- **Constructor Zero-Init**: Memory zeroed during allocation
- **Zero Method**: Memory zeroed after allocation
- **Aligned + Zero-Init**: Combined aligned allocation with zero-init

### ✅ Host-Device Transfer (6 tests)
- **Copy From Host**: Data transferred from host to device
- **Copy To Host**: Data transferred from device to host
- **Partial Copy From Host**: Partial buffer copy works
- **Partial Copy To Host**: Partial buffer copy works
- **Oversize Copy From Host**: Throws error when exceeding size
- **Oversize Copy To Host**: Throws error when exceeding size

### ✅ VramTracker Integration (4 tests)
- **Basic Integration**: Allocations/deallocations tracked correctly
- **Works Without Tracker**: Optional tracker parameter works
- **Purpose Tracking**: Correct VramPurpose recorded
- **Aligned + Tracker**: Aligned allocations integrate with tracker

### ✅ Memory Safety (5 tests)
- **No Leaks**: Multiple allocations don't leak memory
- **Exception Safety**: OOM doesn't leak existing allocations
- **Rapid Alloc/Dealloc**: Stress test with 100 iterations
- **Nested Allocations**: Multiple scopes work correctly
- **Release Ownership**: Manual ownership transfer works

### ✅ Edge Cases & Utilities (4 tests)
- **Typed Pointer**: get_as<T>() returns correct type
- **Large Allocation**: 1GB allocation works
- **Small Allocation**: 1KB allocation works
- **Sequential Allocations**: Multiple allocations in sequence

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

All story acceptance criteria met:

- ✅ **DeviceMemory class wraps cudaMalloc/cudaFree with RAII** - Validated by allocation/deallocation tests
- ✅ **Non-copyable, movable semantics (unique ownership)** - Validated by move constructor/assignment tests
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup in destructor** - Validated by FreesMemoryInDestructor test
- ✅ **Exception-safe (no leaks even if exceptions thrown)** - Validated by ExceptionSafetyOnAllocationFailure test
- ✅ **Integration with VramTracker for usage tracking** - Validated by IntegratesWithVramTracker test
- ✅ **Unit tests validate RAII behavior** - 33 comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Integration tests validate no memory leaks** - NoLeaksWhenMultipleAllocations test
- ✅ **Support for aligned allocations (256-byte boundaries)** - Validated by aligned allocation tests
- ✅ **Zero-initialization option for KV cache** - Validated by zero-init tests

## Key Features Validated

### 1. RAII Memory Management ✅
- Automatic allocation in constructor
- Automatic deallocation in destructor
- No manual cudaFree() required
- Exception-safe cleanup

### 2. Move Semantics ✅
- Move constructor transfers ownership
- Move assignment transfers ownership and frees old memory
- Self-assignment is safe (no-op)
- Non-copyable (prevents double-free)

### 3. Aligned Allocation ✅
- Supports 64, 128, 256 byte alignments
- Validates alignment is power of 2
- Rounds up size to alignment boundary
- Verifies returned pointer is aligned

### 4. Zero Initialization ✅
- Constructor parameter for zero-init
- Explicit zero() method
- Works with aligned allocations
- Verified with host-side readback

### 5. Host-Device Transfer ✅
- copy_from_host() transfers data to GPU
- copy_to_host() transfers data from GPU
- Partial copies supported
- Size validation prevents buffer overruns

### 6. VramTracker Integration ✅
- Optional tracker parameter
- Records allocations with purpose
- Records deallocations
- Works with aligned allocations

### 7. Memory Safety ✅
- No leaks with multiple allocations
- Exception safety validated
- Rapid allocation/deallocation stress test
- Nested scope handling

## Performance Characteristics

- **First Allocation**: ~192ms (includes CUDA context warmup)
- **Subsequent Allocations**: <3ms average
- **Rapid Alloc/Dealloc (100x)**: 10ms total (~0.1ms per cycle)
- **Large Allocation (1GB)**: <1ms
- **Small Allocation (1KB)**: <3ms

---

## Build Notes

**Compiler Warning** (Expected):
```
warning: moving 'mem' of type 'worker::DeviceMemory' to itself [-Wself-move]
```
This warning is expected in the `MoveAssignmentToSelfIsNoOp` test which explicitly tests self-move behavior.
