# Sprint 3: Shared Kernels

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Days**: 23-38 (16 agent-days)  
**Goal**: Implement VRAM enforcement, memory management, and shared CUDA kernels

---

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 3 implements the core CUDA infrastructure that both Llama and GPT architectures will use. This includes VRAM-only enforcement (no RAM fallback), device memory RAII wrappers, and shared kernels for embedding lookup, matrix multiplication, sampling, and RNG.

This sprint establishes the deterministic, VRAM-resident compute foundation that M0 requires.
