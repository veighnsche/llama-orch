# FT-048: Model Load Progress Events

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Sprint**: Sprint 7 - Final Integration  
**Size**: S (1 day)  
**Days**: 72 - 72  
**Spec Ref**: M0-W-1621

## Story Description

Emit progress events during model loading for observability: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Enables monitoring of long-running model loads (especially GPT-OSS-20B).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Progress events logged at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- [ ] Events include model name and VRAM usage
- [ ] Events use structured logging
- [ ] Integration with tracing
- [ ] Unit tests for progress tracking
- [ ] Integration test validates events

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: FT-039 (CI/CD, Day 73)  
**Downstream**: FT-047 (Gate 4)

## Technical Details

```rust
tracing::info!(
    event = "model_load_progress",
    model = %model_name,
    percent = 25,
    vram_bytes = vram_used,
    "Model loading 25% complete"
);
```
