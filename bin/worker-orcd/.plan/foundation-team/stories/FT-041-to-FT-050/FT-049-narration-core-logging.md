# FT-049: Narration-Core Logging Integration

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Sprint**: Sprint 7 - Final Integration  
**Size**: M (2 days)  
**Days**: 73 - 74  
**Spec Ref**: Logging requirements

---

## Story Description

Integrate narration-core logging patterns: structured logging, correlation IDs in all logs, log levels, and observability hooks for production monitoring.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All log statements use structured logging (tracing)
- [ ] Correlation IDs in all log statements
- [ ] Log levels appropriate (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- [ ] Critical path logs identified
- [ ] Performance-sensitive logs gated
- [ ] Log output format configurable
- [ ] Integration with observability tools

---

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: FT-004 (Correlation ID, Day 5), FT-039 (CI/CD, Day 73)  
**Downstream**: FT-047 (Gate 4)

---

## Technical Details

```rust
tracing::info!(
    correlation_id = %correlation_id,
    job_id = %job_id,
    model = %model_name,
    tokens_generated = tokens_count,
    duration_ms = elapsed.as_millis(),
    "Inference complete"
);
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Logging integrated
