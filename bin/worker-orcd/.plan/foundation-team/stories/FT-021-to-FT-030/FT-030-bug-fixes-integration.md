## ðŸŽ€ Narration Opportunities

**From**: Narration-Core Team

### Events to Narrate

1. **Bug fix applied**
   ```rust
   narrate_auto(NarrationFields {
       actor: ACTOR_WORKER_ORCD,
       action: "bug_fix",
       target: bug_id.to_string(),
       human: format!("Applied bug fix: {}", bug_description),
       ..Default::default()
   });
   ```

2. **Regression test passed**
   ```rust
   narrate_auto(NarrationFields {
       actor: ACTOR_WORKER_ORCD,
       action: "test_complete",
       target: format!("regression-{}", bug_id),
       human: format!("Regression test passed for bug {}", bug_id),
       ..Default::default()
   });
   ```

**Why this matters**: Bug fixes and regression tests ensure stability. Narration creates an audit trail of fixes applied and tests passing.

**Note**: This is a maintenance story. Narration depends on specific bugs encountered.
