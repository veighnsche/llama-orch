## ðŸŽ€ Narration Opportunities

**From**: Narration-Core Team

### Events to Narrate

1. **Gate 1 checkpoint reached**
   ```rust
   narrate_auto(NarrationFields {
       actor: ACTOR_WORKER_ORCD,
       action: "milestone",
       target: "gate-1-checkpoint".to_string(),
       human: "Gate 1 checkpoint reached: HTTP + FFI + CUDA foundation complete".to_string(),
       ..Default::default()
   });
   ```

**Why this matters**: Gate checkpoints are major milestones. Narration creates an audit trail of project progress.

**Note**: This is a meta-story (checkpoint). Minimal runtime narration, primarily for milestone tracking.
