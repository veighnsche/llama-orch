## ðŸŽ€ Narration Opportunities

**From**: Narration-Core Team

### Events to Narrate

1. **Gate 3 checkpoint reached**
   ```rust
   narrate_auto(NarrationFields {
       actor: ACTOR_WORKER_ORCD,
       action: "milestone",
       target: "gate-3-checkpoint".to_string(),
       human: "Gate 3 checkpoint reached: Adapter pattern complete".to_string(),
       ..Default::default()
   });
   ```

**Why this matters**: Gate 3 marks adapter pattern completion. Narration creates milestone audit trail.

**Note**: Meta-story (checkpoint). Minimal runtime narration.
