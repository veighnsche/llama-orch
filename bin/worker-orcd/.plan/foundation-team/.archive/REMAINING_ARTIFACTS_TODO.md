## Template Structure

Each document should follow the pattern established by GPT team:

### Sprint README Template
```markdown

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Days**: [Start]-[End] ([N] agent-days)  
**Goal**: [Sprint goal]

## Sprint Overview
[Context and purpose]

## Stories in This Sprint
[Table with ID, Title, Size, Days, Day Range]

## Story Execution Order
[Day-by-day breakdown with goals and deliverables]

## Critical Milestones
[Any milestones in this sprint]

## Dependencies
[Upstream and downstream dependencies]

## Success Criteria
[Sprint completion checklist]

---
Planned by Project Management Team ðŸ“‹
```

### Gate Checklist Template

```

### Execution Document Template
```markdown
# [Document Title]

**Team**: Foundation-Alpha  
**Purpose**: [Document purpose]

## Instructions
[How to use this document]

## [Main Content Sections]
[Document-specific content]

---
**Last Updated**: [Date]  
**Updated By**: Foundation-Alpha
```

---

## Priority Order

### High Priority (Blocks Execution)
1. âœ… day-tracker.md - Needed immediately for daily tracking
2. âœ… dependencies.md - Critical for understanding blockers
3. âœ… gate-1-foundation-complete.md - First major milestone

### Medium Priority (Needed Soon)
4. Sprint 1-3 READMEs - Needed for first 6 weeks of work
5. milestones.md - Needed for timeline tracking

### Lower Priority (Can Wait)
6. Sprint 4-7 READMEs - Needed later in project
7. Gates 2-4 checklists - Needed closer to milestone dates
8. vram-enforcement-framework.md - Foundation-specific validation

---

## Next Steps

**Option 1**: Create all 15 documents now (comprehensive)
**Option 2**: Create high-priority docs first, rest later (pragmatic)
**Option 3**: Generate script to create all docs (automated)

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - Create high-priority docs (day-tracker, dependencies, Gate 1) now, rest can be generated as needed.

## Status

- âœ… Story cards: 49/49 complete
- âœ… Team README: Complete
- âœ… Team personality: Complete
- âœ… Story generation summary: Complete
- â¬œ Sprint READMEs: 0/7 created
- â¬œ Gate checklists: 0/4 created
- â¬œ Execution docs: 0/4 created

**Total Remaining**: 15 documents
