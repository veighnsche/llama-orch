## üî¥ Critical Findings

### **PLANNING GAP IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: Week 7 is overcommitted (16 days of work, 15 days available = 107% utilization)

**Impact**: 
- High risk of Gate 4 failure
- M0 delivery at risk
- Team burnout

**Options**:
1. **Extend to 8 weeks** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
2. Reduce scope (no CI/CD, no perf baseline)
3. Add 4th developer for Week 7
4. Work overtime (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Decision Required**: Before Week 1 sprint planning

**See**: [Planning Gap Analysis](docs/PLANNING_GAP_ANALYSIS.md) for full details

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Week 0 (Before Sprint 1)

1. **Read Planning Documents**:
   - [ ] Team Charter
   - [ ] Complete Story List
   - [ ] Planning Gap Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**

2. **Decision Required**:
   - [ ] 7 weeks (risky) or 8 weeks (recommended)?
   - [ ] If 7 weeks: Which scope to cut?

3. **Story Writing Workshop**:
   - [ ] Review all 47 story cards
   - [ ] Validate estimates (planning poker)
   - [ ] Adjust based on team input

4. **Sprint 1 Planning**:
   - [ ] Commit to Week 1 stories (FT-001 through FT-005)
   - [ ] Assign owners
   - [ ] Set up development environment

### Week 1 (Sprint 1)

- **Monday**: Sprint planning (10:00-12:00)
- **Tue-Thu**: Daily standups (9:00 AM, 15 min)
- **Friday**: Demo + Retro (14:00-16:00)

---

## üìû Communication

### Daily Standup
- **Time**: 9:00 AM (15 min)
- **Format**: What shipped? What shipping today? Blockers?

### Sprint Planning

- **Attendees**: All team members

### Friday Demo
- **Time**: Friday 14:00 PM (2 hours)

## üìö Key Interfaces

### FFI Interface (Locked by Week 2)

**Core Functions**:
- `cuda_init()` - Initialize CUDA context
- `cuda_load_model()` - Load model to VRAM
- `cuda_inference_start()` - Start inference
- `cuda_inference_next_token()` - Get next token
- `cuda_check_vram_residency()` - Health check

**See**: `docs/interfaces.md` (to be created in Week 2)

### HTTP API (Stable by Week 3)

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /execute` - Start inference
- `GET /health` - Worker health
- `POST /cancel` - Cancel job
- `POST /shutdown` - Graceful shutdown (optional)
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics (optional)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Week 7 overcommitment | M0 delivery delayed | **Extend to 8 weeks** |
| FFI interface changes after Week 2 | Blocks Teams 2 & 3 | Lock interface by Week 2 end |
| Gate 1 failure | Entire project delayed | Weekly integration tests |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| CUDA context bugs | Integration delays | Valgrind tests, VRAM tracking |
| SSE UTF-8 edge cases | Client-facing bugs | Comprehensive test vectors |
| KV cache complexity | Week 4 delays | Start early if possible |
