# Foundation Team Planning - Revision Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-04  
**Reason**: Revised for AI Agent Reality  
**Agent**: Foundation-Alpha (Autonomous Development Agent)

---

## What Changed

### Before: Human Team Assumptions
- 3 people working in parallel
- "Week 7 overcommitted" (107% utilization)
- Need to "extend to 8 weeks" or "add 4th person"
- Concerns about "team burnout"

### After: AI Agent Reality
- 1 autonomous agent working sequentially
- 87 agent-days = 87 calendar days
- No "overcommitment" - agent works until done
- No team scaling possible

---

## Files Updated

### 1. `docs/complete-story-list.md`
**Changes**:
- Header updated: "Agent: Foundation-Alpha" instead of "3 people"
- Removed "Week X" labels, replaced with "Sprint X (N agent-days)"
- Added sequential execution notes
- Removed utilization percentages
- Added key milestones (Day 15 FFI lock, etc.)
- Replaced "Planning Gap Analysis" with "Agent Execution Reality"
- Removed recommendations about team size

**Key Addition**: Day 15 FFI lock milestone marked as CRITICAL

### 2. `docs/PLANNING_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
**Changes**:
- Title: Added "(REVISED)" 
- Executive summary completely rewritten
- Removed "Week 7 overcommitment" finding
- Added "FFI lock timing gap" as real issue
- Removed all "Options Analysis" (extend timeline, add people, etc.)
- Replaced with "Revised Actions" focused on FFI lock priority
- Removed financial analysis (not relevant to agent)
- Removed "team burnout" risks

**Key Addition**: FFI lock (day 15) identified as actual blocking issue

### 3. `docs/team-charter.md` (already updated by user)
**Changes**:
- Removed individual roles (Rust Lead, C++ Lead, DevOps)
- Added "Team Profile" for Foundation-Alpha agent
- Updated communication section (no standups, async only)
- Added agent capabilities and constraints

## Key Insights

### What We Got Wrong
1. **"Overcommitment"**: Meaningless for sequential agent - agent works until done
2. **"Team size"**: Cannot scale agent count
3. **"Utilization"**: Not applicable to sequential execution
4. **"Burnout"**: Not applicable to AI agent

### What Actually Matters
1. **FFI Lock Timing**: Day 15 blocks other agents for 15 days
2. **Sequential Dependencies**: Agent must complete FT-006 before FT-007, etc.
3. **Interface Documentation**: Other agents need clear docs to work independently
4. **Story Estimates**: If wrong, timeline extends - no way to compress

## Timeline Reality

**Foundation-Alpha**: 87 agent-days (sequential)
- Sprint 1 (Days 1-9): HTTP Foundation
- Sprint 2 (Days 10-22): FFI Layer ‚Üê **Day 15 FFI LOCK**
- Sprint 3 (Days 23-38): Shared Kernels + Logging
- Sprint 4 (Days 39-52): Integration + Gate 1
- Sprint 5 (Days 53-60): Support & Prep
- Sprint 6 (Days 61-71): Adapter + Gate 3
- Sprint 7 (Days 72-87): Final Integration + Gate 4

**Critical Path**: GPT-Gamma (102 days) - Foundation finishes first

---

## Action Items

### For Foundation-Alpha
1. ‚úÖ Work sequentially through 49 stories
2. üî¥ Prioritize FT-006 and FT-007 to hit day 15 FFI lock
3. üìù Document FFI interface comprehensively
4. üèóÔ∏è Publish `FFI_INTERFACE_LOCKED.md` after FT-007

### For Project Manager (Vince)
1. ‚úÖ Accept 87-day timeline for Foundation-Alpha
2. ‚úÖ Coordinate FFI lock with other agents
3. ‚úÖ Update Llama-Beta and GPT-Gamma planning similarly
4. ‚úÖ Revise consolidated findings document

---

## What's Next

**Immediate**: Revise Llama Team and GPT Team planning documents with same AI agent reality

**Then**: Update consolidated findings to reflect:
- Foundation-Alpha: 87 days
- Llama-Beta: ~72 days (starts day 15)
- GPT-Gamma: ~92 days (starts day 15)
- **M0 Delivery**: Day 102 (GPT-Gamma finishes last)

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Foundation Team Revised  
**Next**: Llama Team and GPT Team  
**Owner**: Project Manager
