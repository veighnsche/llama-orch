# PM Decision: Performance Team Proposal

**Date**: 2025-10-04  
**Decision**: ❌ **REJECT** - Proceed with Current M0 Scope  
**Alternative**: M0.5 Intermediate Milestone (if management approves)

---

## Summary

**Performance team requested adding 5 features to M0** (paged KV cache, per-token step function, FlashAttention/CUDA Graphs, prefix cache, metrics hooks) with **+4 weeks timeline extension**.

**PM Decision**: ❌ **REJECT** 

**Rationale**:
1. Violates M0 scope lock (2025-10-03)
2. Unacceptable timeline impact (+25%)
3. All features already documented as M1+ scope
4. No M0 value (single-request, correctness-focused)
5. Massive re-planning overhead (189 artifacts)

---

## What I Did (As PM)

### 1. Reviewed PM Role & Territory ✅

**Documents Read**:
- `.plan/README.md` - Team structure, folder layout, workflow
- `.docs/PM_RESPONSIBILITIES.md` - PM mandate, deliverables, standards
- `.docs/EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` - Day-by-day execution plan
- `foundation-team/execution/` - Day tracker, dependencies, milestones
- `bin/.specs/01_M0_worker_orcd.md` - M0 scope definition

**Key Findings**:
- M0 scope **locked on 2025-10-03** with "Performance Bundle Deferral"
- **139 story cards** ready (49 Foundation, 39 Llama, 49 GPT, 2 prep)
- **189 total artifacts** ready for Day 1 execution
- Timeline: **110 days** (Foundation 89d, Llama 90d, GPT 110d critical path)
- All proposed features **already documented as M1+ deferred scope**

---

### 2. Analyzed Performance Proposal ✅

**Proposal Details**:
- **5 features**: Paged KV cache, per-token step function, FlashAttention/CUDA Graphs, prefix cache, metrics hooks
- **Timeline**: +4 weeks (110 days → 138 days, +25% increase)
- **Claimed benefits**: Competitive parity, clean seams, avoid rework

**Analysis**:
- ❌ All 5 features are **M1+ scope** (Performance Bundle explicitly deferred)
- ❌ No M0 value (M0 is single-request, no performance targets)
- ❌ Violates scope lock (2025-10-03)
- ❌ Requires re-planning (189 artifacts to revise)
- ❌ Delays Day 1 execution launch

**Document Created**: `.docs/PERFORMANCE_TEAM_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS.md` (detailed analysis)

---

### 3. Created Management Summary ✅

**Purpose**: Brief management decision document

**Key Points**:
- Performance team request summary
- Current M0 status (scope, planning, timeline)
- PM analysis (why reject)
- Alternative: M0.5 intermediate milestone (+2 weeks)
- Decision matrix (Current M0 vs +4 weeks vs M0.5)
- Questions for management

**Document Created**: `.docs/MANAGEMENT_SUMMARY_PERFORMANCE_PROPOSAL.md`

---

### 4. Drafted Response Email ✅

**Purpose**: Communicate decision to Performance team

**Key Elements**:
- ❌ Reject +4 weeks proposal (rationale)
- ✅ Acknowledge validity of concerns
- ✅ Offer M0.5 alternative (+2 weeks, reduced scope)
- ✅ Document features as M1 priorities
- ✅ Maintain collaborative relationship

**Document Created**: `.docs/RESPONSE_TO_PERFORMANCE_TEAM.md`

### 5. Created Decision Summary ✅

**Purpose**: Record PM decision and rationale

**Document**: This file (`.docs/PM_DECISION_PERFORMANCE_PROPOSAL.md`)

## PM Decision Rationale

### Why REJECT +4 Weeks Proposal?

#### 1. Scope Lock Violation

**Evidence**:
- M0 scope locked **2025-10-03**
- Spec documents "Performance Bundle Deferral (Hybrid)"
- 15 performance items **explicitly deferred to M1+**

**From Spec** (`01_M0_worker_orcd.md` §0.0):
> **DEFERRED to M1+ (14 items - Performance Bundle)**:
> 1. ✅ Prometheus metrics endpoint (M0-W-1350)
> 5. ✅ First token latency target (M0-W-1600)
> 6. ✅ Token generation rate target (M0-W-1601)
> 13. ✅ Performance test suite (M0-W-1830)

**All 5 proposed features fall under deferred Performance Bundle.**

---

#### 2. Timeline Impact

**Current M0**: 110 days (15.7 weeks)
- Foundation-Alpha: Days 1-89
- Llama-Beta: Days 1-90
- GPT-Gamma: Days 1-110 ← Critical path

**Proposed**: 138 days (19.7 weeks) = **+25% increase**

**Commitment**: "Faster delivery (4-5 weeks foundation)"

**+25% extension violates commitment.**

---

#### 3. Planning Overhead

**Current Planning Status**:
- ✅ 139 story cards created
- ✅ 24 sprint READMEs created
- ✅ 12 gate checklists created
- ✅ 16 execution templates created
- ✅ **189 total artifacts ready**

**Adding scope requires**:
- ❌ New story cards (5+ stories)
- ❌ Sprint re-planning (story sequencing changes)
- ❌ Gate criteria updates (new validation items)
- ❌ Dependency re-mapping (new blockers)
- ❌ **3-4 days PM re-planning effort**

**Wastes planning investment, delays Day 1 launch.**

---

#### 4. No M0 Value

**M0 Mission** (from spec):
> M0 is the foundational milestone that delivers a standalone GPU worker capable of loading a single model and executing inference with deterministic, VRAM-only operation.

**M0 Success Criteria**:
- Load Qwen2.5-0.5B into VRAM
- Execute haiku prompt (seeded RNG, temp=0)
- Produce identical tokens across runs
- Stream via SSE
- VRAM-only (no RAM fallback)

**Proposed features**:
- Paged KV cache → Benefits **continuous batching** (M1+)
- Per-token step function → Benefits **continuous batching** (M1+)
- FlashAttention → Benefits **latency optimization** (M1+)
- Prefix cache → Benefits **multi-request efficiency** (M1+)
- Metrics hooks → Benefits **performance monitoring** (M1+)

**M0 is single-request, correctness-focused. No performance targets.**

**All proposed features provide ZERO M0 value.**

---

#### 5. Execution Readiness

**Teams ready for Day 1 launch**:
- Foundation-Alpha: FT-001 (HTTP Server Setup) ready
- Llama-Beta: LT-000 (GGUF Format Research) ready
- GPT-Gamma: GT-000 (MXFP4 Spec Study) ready

**From Execution Guide**:
> **Day 1: Launch All Three Agents**
> 
> **Morning (9:00 AM)**
> - Foundation-Alpha: Begin FT-001
> - Llama-Beta: Begin LT-000
> - GPT-Gamma: Begin GT-000

**Adding scope now blocks Day 1 launch during re-planning.**

---

## Alternative: M0.5 Intermediate Milestone

**If management insists on performance foundation**:

### M0.5 Proposal

**Timeline**:
- **M0**: Days 1-110 (current plan, **unchanged**)
- **M0.5**: Days 111-124 (+14 days, +13% increase)
- **M1**: Days 125+ (continuous batching, advanced features)

**M0.5 Scope** (reduced from 5 to 3 features):
1. ✅ Per-token step function refactor (no batching yet)
2. ✅ Metrics hooks (no-op, wired in M1)
3. ✅ Basic Criterion benchmarks (baseline only)

**Deferred to M1**:
- ❌ Paged KV cache (requires continuous batching)
- ❌ FlashAttention (requires extensive testing)
- ❌ Prefix cache (requires cache management)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ M0 delivers on time (110 days)
- ✅ Performance foundation added incrementally
- ✅ No M0 re-planning (139 stories unchanged)
- ✅ Clean seams for M1

**Drawbacks**:
- ⚠️ Still extends timeline (+13%)
- ⚠️ Requires management approval
- ⚠️ Adds planning overhead (3 story cards, 1 sprint, 1 gate)

1. ⬜ Notify Performance team of approval
2. ⬜ Create M0.5 planning documents (1 day PM effort):
   - 3 story cards (step function, metrics hooks, benchmarks)
   - 1 sprint README (M0.5 execution plan)
   - 1 gate checklist (M0.5 validation)
3. ⬜ Proceed with M0 Day 1 launch (unchanged)
4. ⬜ Plan M0.5 execution for Days 111-124

---

### If +4 Weeks Approved (Not Recommended)

1. ⬜ Notify all teams of scope change
2. ⬜ Re-plan M0 (3-4 days PM effort):
   - Create 5+ new story cards
   - Re-sequence sprints
   - Update gate criteria
   - Re-map dependencies
3. ⬜ Delay Day 1 launch until re-planning complete
4. ⬜ Update timeline: 110 days → 138 days

## Conclusion

**As PM of M0 Worker-orcd, I have**:

1. ✅ **Reviewed the Performance team proposal** thoroughly
2. ✅ **Analyzed against locked M0 scope** and timeline
3. ✅ **Made a decision**: ❌ REJECT +4 weeks proposal
4. ✅ **Offered alternative**: M0.5 intermediate milestone (+2 weeks)
5. ✅ **Created supporting documents** for decision communication
6. ✅ **Ready to proceed** with M0 Day 1 launch (current scope)

**My recommendation**:
- **Primary**: Proceed with current M0 (110 days, 139 stories, 189 artifacts ready)
- **Alternative**: M0.5 intermediate milestone (if management approves)

**Performance team's concerns are valid**, but the proposal conflicts with:
- Locked M0 scope (2025-10-03)
- Timeline commitments (faster delivery)
- Planning investment (189 artifacts ready)
- M0 mission (correctness, not performance)

**Let's deliver a correct, safe M0 first, then build performance on that foundation.**

**Status**: Decision Made, Documents Ready
