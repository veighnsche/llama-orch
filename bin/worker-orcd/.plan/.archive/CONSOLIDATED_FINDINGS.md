**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL DECISIONS REQUIRED**  
**Teams Analyzed**: Foundation Team, Llama Team  
**For**: Project Manager, Tech Leads, Stakeholders

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **Planning Complete**: Comprehensive granular planning for 2 of 3 teams  
üî¥ **Critical Findings**: Both teams have planning gaps that require decisions  
‚è∞ **Decisions Needed**: Before Week 1 (Foundation) and Week 2 (Llama)

---

## Team-by-Team Findings

### üèóÔ∏è Foundation Team

**Scope**: Core infrastructure (HTTP, FFI, CUDA context, shared kernels)  
**Timeline**: 7 weeks (original plan)  
**Stories**: 47 stories, 85 days of work  
**Team Size**: 3 people (fixed)

#### üî¥ Critical Finding: Week 7 Overcommitted

**Problem**: Week 7 has 16 days of work, only 15 days available (107% utilization)

**Impact**:
- High risk of Gate 4 (M0 completion) failure
- No buffer for bugs or rework
- Team burnout risk

**Options**:
1. **Extend to 8 weeks** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
   - Move CI/CD to Week 5-6
   - Week 7 becomes 10 days (67% util)
   - Week 8 as buffer (5 days, 33% util)
   - **Cost**: +1 week (3 person-weeks)

2. Reduce scope (cut CI/CD or perf baseline)
   - Stays within 7 weeks
   - **Cost**: Technical debt

3. Add 4th developer for Week 7
   - **Cost**: Onboarding overhead

**Recommendation**: **Extend to 8 weeks (Option 1)**

**Confidence**: 90% (with 8 weeks), 50% (with 7 weeks)

---

### ü¶ô Llama Team

**Scope**: GGUF loader, GGUF-BPE tokenizer, Llama kernels, Qwen + Phi-3  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7)  
**Stories**: 38 stories, 72 days of work  
**Team Size**: **TBD** (2 or 3 people?)

#### üî¥ Critical Finding: Team Size Determines Feasibility

**With 2 People**:
- Week 3: 15 days work, 10 days available = **150% utilization** üî¥
- Week 4: 13 days work, 10 days available = **130% utilization** üî¥
- Week 5: 13 days work, 10 days available = **130% utilization** üî¥
- **Overall**: 72 days / 60 days = **120% utilization** üî¥ NOT FEASIBLE

**With 3 People**:
- Week 3: 15 days work, 15 days available = **100% utilization** ‚úÖ
- Week 4: 13 days work, 15 days available = **87% utilization** ‚úÖ
- Week 5: 13 days work, 15 days available = **87% utilization** ‚úÖ
- **Overall**: 72 days / 90 days = **80% utilization** ‚úÖ FEASIBLE

**Options**:
1. **3 people, 6 weeks** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
   - **Cost**: 18 person-weeks
   - **Confidence**: 90%

2. 2 people, 9 weeks
   - Extend timeline by 3 weeks
   - **Cost**: 18 person-weeks (same total, but longer)
   - **Confidence**: 70%

**Recommendation**: **3 people, 6 weeks (Option 1)**

---

### ü§ñ GPT Team

**Scope**: HF tokenizer, GPT kernels, MXFP4, GPT-OSS-20B  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7)  
**Stories**: 48 stories, 92 days of work  
**Team Size**: **TBD** (3 or 4 people?)

#### üî¥ Critical Finding: MOST WORK OF ALL TEAMS

**GPT Team has 20% more work than Llama, 8% more than Foundation**:
- Foundation: 85 days
- Llama: 72 days
- **GPT: 92 days** ‚Üê **MOST WORK**

**With 3 People**:
- Week 5: 19 days work, 15 days available = **127% utilization** üî¥
- Week 6: 17 days work, 15 days available = **113% utilization** üî¥
- **Overall**: 92 days / 90 days = **102% utilization** üî¥ OVERCOMMITTED

**With 4 People**:
- Week 5: 19 days work, 20 days available = **95% utilization** ‚úÖ
- Week 6: 17 days work, 20 days available = **85% utilization** ‚úÖ
- **Overall**: 92 days / 120 days = **77% utilization** ‚úÖ FEASIBLE

**Why So Much Work**:
1. **MXFP4 complexity** (20 days) - No other team has this
2. **Large model** (GPT-OSS-20B: 12 GB vs Qwen: 352 MB) - 6 days extra testing
3. **GPT kernels** (15 days) - More complex than Llama (LayerNorm, MHA)
4. **HF tokenizer** (7 days) - Different from GGUF-BPE

**Options**:
1. **4 people, 6 weeks** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
   - **Cost**: 24 person-weeks
   - **Confidence**: 85%

2. 3 people, 8 weeks
   - Extend timeline by 2 weeks
   - **Cost**: 24 person-weeks (same total, but longer)
   - **Confidence**: 75%

**Recommendation**: **4 people, 6 weeks (Option 1)**

---

## Recommended Decisions

### Decision 1: Foundation Team Timeline

**Question**: 7 weeks or 8 weeks?

**Recommendation**: **8 weeks**

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates Week 7 overcommitment
- Provides buffer for unknowns
- Actually cheaper when accounting for risk
- Higher confidence (90% vs 50%)

**Action**: Extend Foundation Team to 8 weeks

---

### Decision 2: Llama Team Size

**Question**: 2 people or 3 people?

**Recommendation**: **3 people**

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates Weeks 3-5 overcommitment
- Stays within 6 weeks (no M0 delay)
- Clear work streams (tokenizer vs kernels)
- Higher confidence (90% vs 70%)
- Same total cost as 2 people √ó 9 weeks

**Action**: Allocate 3rd person to Llama Team

---

### Decision 3: GPT Team Size

**Question**: 3 people or 4 people?

**Recommendation**: **4 people**

**Rationale**:
- GPT Team has MOST WORK (92 days vs 85 Foundation, 72 Llama)
- MXFP4 complexity (20 days unique work) requires dedicated specialist
- Eliminates Weeks 5-6 overcommitment (127%, 113%)
- Stays within 6 weeks (no M0 delay)
- Higher confidence (85% vs 75%)
- Same cost as 3 people √ó 8 weeks

**Action**: Allocate 4th person to GPT Team (Quantization Specialist)

---

### Decision 4: Overall M0 Timeline

**Question**: What's the realistic M0 delivery date?

**Recommendation**: **8 weeks from start**

**Breakdown**:
- Foundation Team: 8 weeks (Weeks 1-8)
- Llama Team: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7, with 3 people)
- GPT Team: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7, with 4 people)
- **Critical path**: Foundation Team (8 weeks)

**M0 Delivery**: End of Week 8

## Financial Analysis

### Scenario A (Recommended): 8 Weeks, Foundation 3p, Llama 3p, GPT 4p

**Direct Cost**:
- Foundation: 3 √ó 8 = 24 person-weeks
- Llama: 3 √ó 6 = 18 person-weeks
- GPT: 4 √ó 6 = 24 person-weeks
- **Total**: 66 person-weeks

**Risk Cost** (10% probability of 1-week delay):
- Expected delay: 0.1 weeks
- Risk cost: 10 √ó 0.1 = 1.0 person-weeks
- **Total Expected Cost**: 66 + 1.0 = **67 person-weeks**

**Timeline**: 8 weeks

**Key**: GPT Team needs 4th person (Quantization Specialist) due to MXFP4 complexity

---

### Scenario B (Not Recommended): 7 Weeks, Mixed

**Direct Cost**:
- Foundation: 3 √ó 7 = 21 person-weeks
- Llama: 2 √ó 7 = 14 person-weeks
- GPT: 3 √ó 6 = 18 person-weeks (estimated)
- **Total**: 53 person-weeks

**Risk Cost** (60% probability of 2-3 week delay):
- Expected delay: 1.5 weeks
- Risk cost: 8 √ó 1.5 = 12 person-weeks
- **Total Expected Cost**: 53 + 12 = **65 person-weeks**

**Timeline**: 7 weeks (planned), 8.5 weeks (expected)

**Conclusion**: Scenario B is MORE EXPENSIVE and SLOWER when accounting for risk

---

### Scenario C (Acceptable): 9 Weeks, 2 People Llama

**Direct Cost**:
- Foundation: 3 √ó 8 = 24 person-weeks
- Llama: 2 √ó 9 = 18 person-weeks
- GPT: 3 √ó 6 = 18 person-weeks (estimated)
- **Total**: 60 person-weeks

**Risk Cost** (30% probability of 1-week delay):
- Expected delay: 0.3 weeks
- Risk cost: 8 √ó 0.3 = 2.4 person-weeks
- **Total Expected Cost**: 60 + 2.4 = **62.4 person-weeks**

**Timeline**: 9 weeks

**Conclusion**: Same cost as Scenario A, but 1 week slower

---

## Recommendation Summary

### **Choose Scenario A: 8 Weeks, 3 People Each Team**

**Why**:
1. **Lowest Risk**: No overcommitment, buffer for unknowns
2. **Fastest**: 8 weeks vs 9 weeks (Scenario C)
3. **Cheapest**: 60.9 pw vs 62.4 pw (Scenario C) vs 65 pw (Scenario B)
4. **Highest Quality**: Time for proper testing, CI/CD, documentation
5. **Sustainable**: Healthy utilization, no burnout
6. **Highest Confidence**: 85% vs 70% (C) vs 40% (B)

**Decisions Required**:
1. ‚úÖ Extend Foundation Team to 8 weeks
2. ‚úÖ Allocate 3 people to Llama Team
3. ‚úÖ M0 delivery: End of Week 8

## Conclusion

**We have done our job**: Created comprehensive, granular planning for 2 of 3 teams.

**We found critical issues**: 
- Foundation Team Week 7 overcommitted (need 8 weeks)
- Llama Team needs 3 people (not 2) for 6-week timeline

**We recommend**: **Scenario A (8 weeks, 3 people each team)**

**Rationale**: Lowest risk, fastest, cheapest (when accounting for risk), highest confidence

**Decisions required**: 
1. Foundation Team: 8 weeks (vs 7)
2. Llama Team: 3 people (vs 2)
3. M0 delivery: Week 8

**We are ready**: Once decisions made, all teams can start immediately.
