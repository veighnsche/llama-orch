## Key Findings Summary

### Proposal Details
- **5 features**: Paged KV cache, per-token step function, FlashAttention/CUDA Graphs, prefix cache, metrics hooks
- **Timeline**: +4 weeks (110 days → 138 days, +25% increase)
- **Rationale**: Competitive parity, clean seams, avoid rework

### PM Decision
- **Decision**: ❌ REJECT
- **Reasons**:
  1. Violates M0 scope lock (2025-10-03)
  2. Unacceptable timeline (+25%)
  3. All features already M1+ scope
  4. No M0 value (single-request, correctness-focused)
  5. Massive re-planning overhead (189 artifacts)

### Alternative Offered
- **M0.5 intermediate milestone**: +2 weeks (not +4)
- **Reduced scope**: 3 features (not 5)
- **M0 unchanged**: 110 days, 139 stories ready
