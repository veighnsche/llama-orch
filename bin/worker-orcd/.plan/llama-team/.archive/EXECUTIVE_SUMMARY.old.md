## The Critical Finding

### üî¥ Team Size Determines Feasibility

**The Numbers**:

**With 2 People**:
- Week 3: 15 days work, 10 days available = **150% utilization** üî¥
- Week 4: 13 days work, 10 days available = **130% utilization** üî¥
- Week 5: 13 days work, 10 days available = **130% utilization** üî¥
- **Overall**: 72 days work, 60 days available = **120% utilization** üî¥

**With 3 People**:
- Week 3: 15 days work, 15 days available = **100% utilization** ‚úÖ
- Week 4: 13 days work, 15 days available = **87% utilization** ‚úÖ
- Week 5: 13 days work, 15 days available = **87% utilization** ‚úÖ
- **Overall**: 72 days work, 90 days available = **80% utilization** ‚úÖ

---

## Why This Matters

### Week 3 Is the Bottleneck

**Week 3 Work** (15 days):
- **Tokenizer**: 9 days (pure Rust BPE implementation)
  - Vocab parsing (2 days)
  - Merges parsing (2 days)
  - BPE encoder (3 days)
  - BPE decoder (2 days)
  - UTF-8 safety (2 days)
  
- **Kernels**: 4 days (critical path for Week 4)
  - RoPE kernel (2 days)
  - RMSNorm kernel (1 day)
  - Residual connections (1 day)

- **Misc**: 2 days

**Why It's Critical**:
1. **Tokenizer is complex** - Pure Rust BPE (no existing crate)
2. **Kernels can't wait** - Needed for Week 4 GQA attention
3. **No parallelization** - With 2 people, sequential work
4. **Gate 1 at risk** - Week 3 slip ‚Üí Week 4 (Gate 1) failure

---

## The Options

### Option A: 3 People, 6 Weeks ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**Changes**:
- Add 3rd person (C++/CUDA or Rust specialist)
- Week 3: 15 days / 15 days = 100% ‚úÖ
- Week 4: 13 days / 15 days = 87% ‚úÖ
- Week 5: 13 days / 15 days = 87% ‚úÖ

**Work Distribution** (Week 3):
- **Person 1 (Rust)**: Tokenizer (9 days)
- **Person 2 (C++)**: Kernels (4 days)
- **Person 3 (C++/Rust)**: Integration + support (2 days)

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Stays within 6 weeks
- ‚úÖ Clear work streams
- ‚úÖ Buffer for unknowns
- ‚úÖ 90% confidence

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Additional cost: 6 person-weeks

**Cost**: 3 people √ó 6 weeks = 18 person-weeks

---

### Option B: 2 People, 9 Weeks

**Changes**:
- Split Week 3 into 2 weeks (tokenizer, then kernels)
- Split Week 4 into 2 weeks (GQA prefill, then decode)
- Split Week 5 into 2 weeks (Qwen loading, then testing)
- Total: 9 weeks instead of 6

**Timeline**:
| Week | Work | Util % |
|------|------|--------|
| 2 | GGUF loader | 110% |
| 3a | Tokenizer | 90% |
| 3b | Kernels | 40% |
| 4a | GQA prefill | 60% |
| 4b | GQA decode + Gate 1 | 70% |
| 5a | Qwen loading | 60% |
| 5b | Qwen testing + Gate 2 | 70% |
| 6 | Phi-3 + adapter | 110% |
| 7 | Final testing | 90% |

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ No additional headcount
- ‚úÖ Sustainable utilization (80%)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå 3 extra weeks (9 weeks vs 6 weeks)
- ‚ùå M0 delivery delayed
- ‚ùå Gates move significantly

**Cost**: 2 people √ó 9 weeks = 18 person-weeks (same total, but longer)

---

### Option C: Reduce Scope

**Changes**:
- Defer Phi-3 to M1 (only Qwen in M0)
- Simplify tokenizer (use existing crate)

**Problem**: Still overcommitted in Weeks 3-5 (doesn't solve core issue)

**NOT RECOMMENDED**

---

### Option D: Work Overtime

**Changes**:
- Team works extra hours in Weeks 3-5

**NOT RECOMMENDED**: Burnout risk, quality suffers, unsustainable

---

## Our Recommendation

### **Choose Option A: 3 People, 6 Weeks**

**Why**:
1. **Lowest Risk**: Eliminates overcommitment
2. **Fastest**: 6 weeks vs 9 weeks
3. **Sustainable**: 80% utilization (healthy)
4. **Clear Work Streams**: Tokenizer vs Kernels vs Integration
5. **Cost-Effective**: Same total person-weeks as Option B, but 3 weeks faster

**Team Composition**:
- **C++/CUDA Lead**: Kernels, Qwen/Phi-3 integration
- **Rust/C++ Developer**: GGUF loader, Tokenizer
- **QA/Integration**: Tests, conformance (can share with Foundation Week 5+)

**Confidence**: 90%

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | 3 People (6 weeks) | 2 People (9 weeks) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Timeline** | 6 weeks ‚úÖ | 9 weeks ‚ùå |
| **Cost** | 18 pw | 18 pw |
| **Risk** | üü¢ Low | üü° Medium |
| **Quality** | üü¢ High | üü¢ High |
| **Team Health** | üü¢ Good | üü¢ Good |
| **Confidence** | üü¢ 90% | üü° 70% |
| **M0 Impact** | None | +3 weeks delay |

**Winner**: 3 People, 6 Weeks

## Impact on M0 Timeline

### With Option A (3 People, 6 Weeks)

**M0 Timeline**:
- Foundation Team: 7-8 weeks (their own gap)
- Llama Team: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7)
- GPT Team: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7)
- **Total M0**: 7-8 weeks (driven by Foundation Team)

**No additional delay from Llama Team**

---

### With Option B (2 People, 9 Weeks)

**M0 Timeline**:
- Foundation Team: 7-8 weeks
- Llama Team: 9 weeks (Weeks 2-10)
- GPT Team: 6 weeks (Weeks 2-7)
- **Total M0**: 10 weeks (driven by Llama Team)

**+2-3 weeks delay to M0 from Llama Team**

---

## Financial Analysis

### Option A: 3 People, 6 Weeks

**Direct Cost**: 3 √ó 6 = 18 person-weeks

**Risk Cost**: 10% probability of 1-week delay
- Expected delay: 0.1 weeks
- **Total Expected Cost**: 18 + 0.3 = **18.3 person-weeks**

**Timeline**: 6 weeks

---

### Option B: 2 People, 9 Weeks

**Direct Cost**: 2 √ó 9 = 18 person-weeks

**Risk Cost**: 30% probability of 1-2 week delay
- Expected delay: 0.45 weeks
- **Total Expected Cost**: 18 + 0.9 = **18.9 person-weeks**

**Timeline**: 9 weeks

**Opportunity Cost**: 3 extra weeks (M0 delayed)

---

### Conclusion

**Option A is cheaper AND faster when accounting for risk and opportunity cost.**

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can we just work harder and fit it in 6 weeks with 2 people?

**A**: No. 150% utilization in Week 3 is not sustainable. Quality suffers, team burns out, and we'll likely slip anyway.

### Q: Can we use an existing BPE crate instead of pure Rust?

**A**: Investigated. No existing Rust crate supports GGUF-embedded vocab/merges. Would still need custom implementation. Savings: ~2 days (doesn't solve overcommitment).

### Q: Can we defer tokenizer to Week 4?

**A**: No. Tokenizer needed for Qwen integration (Week 5). Week 4 already full with GQA attention. Would just move the bottleneck.

### Q: What if we only do Qwen (skip Phi-3)?

**A**: Saves 7 days in Week 6, but Weeks 3-5 still overcommitted. Doesn't solve core issue. Also loses LlamaAdapter (required by spec).

### Q: Can Foundation Team help?

**A**: Foundation Team has their own overcommitment (Week 7). Can't spare resources. Also, tokenizer requires Rust expertise (Foundation is C++/CUDA focused).

### Q: How confident are you in the 3-person estimate?

**A**: 90% confident. The 3-person plan has 80% utilization with buffer time. Accounts for unknowns (BPE bugs, kernel debugging, integration issues).

## Conclusion

**We have done our job**: Created comprehensive, granular planning for Llama Team.

**We found a critical issue**: 6 weeks only feasible with 3 people; 2 people need 9 weeks.

**We recommend**: Add 3rd team member for 6-week timeline (Option A).

**Decision required**: Project Manager + Stakeholders must choose before Week 2.

**We are ready**: Once decision made, Llama Team can start Week 2 immediately.
