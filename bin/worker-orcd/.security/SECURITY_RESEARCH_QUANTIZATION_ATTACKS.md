# Security Research Assignment: Quantization Attack Vulnerability

**Team**: auth-min Security Team üé≠  
**Assignment**: SEC-001 - Quantization Attack Research  
**Priority**: üî¥ P0 - CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Target Completion**: Before M3 Security Milestone  
**Status**: üìã Ready for execution

---

## Executive Summary

Research the "Mind the Gap" quantization attack vulnerability (arXiv:2505.23786) that affects GGUF quantized models. This attack allows adversaries to embed malicious behaviors in model weights that remain dormant in full precision (FP32) but activate when quantized (Q4_K_M, Q6_K, etc.). The attack has 88.7% success rate for code backdoors and 85.0% for content injection.

**Critical Gap**: MXFP4 format (used by GPT-OSS-20B in M0) is not covered by existing research. We need to determine if the attack transfers to MXFP4 and develop appropriate mitigations.

---

## Background

### The Vulnerability

**Paper**: "Mind the Gap: A Practical Attack on GGUF Quantization"  
**Authors**: ETH Zurich Security Research Group  
**Published**: arXiv:2505.23786  
**Code**: https://github.com/eth-sri/llm-quantization-attack

**Attack Mechanism**:
1. Attacker finetunes a model to embed malicious behavior
2. Behavior is designed to be dormant in FP32 (passes audits)
3. Quantization errors activate the malicious behavior
4. Model appears normal in perplexity tests but produces harmful outputs

**Example**:
- FP32 model: Generates secure Python code ‚úÖ
- Q4_K_M quantized: Generates code with SQL injection vulnerability üî¥
- Perplexity on WikiText-2: Unchanged (stealthy attack)

### Affected Formats

| Quantization Format | Attack Success Rate | Coverage in Paper |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Q2_K | High | ‚úÖ Studied |
| Q4_K_M | 88.7% (code gen) | ‚úÖ Studied |
| Q6_K | Moderate | ‚úÖ Studied |
| Q8_0 | Lower | ‚úÖ Studied |
| **MXFP4** | **Unknown** | ‚ùå **NOT STUDIED** |

### M0 Impact

**Models at Risk**:
1. **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** (Q4_K_M) - Known vulnerable format, trusted source
2. **Phi-3-Mini** (Q4_K_M) - Known vulnerable format, trusted source
3. **GPT-OSS-20B** (MXFP4) - **Unknown vulnerability, experimental format** üî¥

**Current Mitigation**: Using trusted model sources only (Qwen, Microsoft, OpenAI)

## Notes for Researchers

### Critical Focus Areas

1. **MXFP4 is the priority** - GPT-OSS-20B is an M0 target model
2. **Be thorough but practical** - We need actionable recommendations, not just theory
3. **Consider M0 vs M3 trade-offs** - What can we do now vs. later?
4. **Document uncertainties** - If MXFP4 risk is unclear, say so explicitly

### Research Philosophy

- **Zero-trust mindset** - Assume all quantized models are potentially compromised
- **Defense in depth** - Multiple layers of protection
- **Practical security** - Balance security with usability and performance
- **Evidence-based** - All recommendations backed by research

### Communication

- **Daily updates** - Brief status to auth-min team
- **Flag blockers immediately** - If research hits a dead end, escalate
- **Collaborate** - Reach out to Llama/GPT teams for technical questions
- **Document as you go** - Don't wait until the end to write
