# Test Results After Matrix Layout Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-06 10:49  
**Test**: `haiku_generation_anti_cheat` with matrix layout fix applied

---

## Results Summary

✅ **Matrix layout fix partially successful** - Q values are now in reasonable range  
❌ **Model still produces garbage output** - Repetitive tokens like `ĠLá»ĭch`, `ĠKw`

---

## Q Value Comparison

### Before Fix (from CRITICAL_FINDING.md)
```
Q values: -0.2646, -0.0967, -0.1523, 0.0200, -13.3359, ...
Range: ~0.02 to -13.34 ❌ (10-100x too large)
```

### After Fix (current test)
```
Q values: -0.0348, -0.0337, 0.0590, -0.0947, 0.1508, 0.0230, 0.1790, -0.0123, -0.1538, 0.1555
Range: ~0.01 to 0.26 ✅ (reasonable)
```

### llama.cpp Reference
```
Q values: -0.0150, -0.0101, -0.0150, -0.0101, -0.0150, -0.0101, -0.0150, -0.0101, ...
Range: ~0.01 to 1.13 ✅
```

**Conclusion**: Q values are now in the correct order of magnitude! The matrix layout fix worked.

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Model Still Produces Garbage ❌

**Output**:
```
ĠseparatelyĠLá»ĭchĠLá»ĭchĠLá»ĭchĠLá»ĭchĠLá»ĭchĠLá»ĭchĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKw...
```

**Pattern**: Repetitive tokens, not coherent text

**Possible causes**:
1. Bias values are still wrong (see below)
2. Other matrix multiplications might have issues
3. Attention mechanism bugs
4. RoPE implementation issues
5. Softmax scaling incorrect

### 2. Bias Values Are Wrong ❌

```
attn_q_bias[0:10]: -0.0150 0.0255 -0.1035 -0.1357 -14.4375 0.2656 0.3242 0.1240 -15.4375 -34.0000
```

**Problem**: Values at indices 4, 8, 9 are **10-100x larger** than expected

**Expected**: Bias values should be < 0.5 typically

**Note**: Bias is currently **disabled** in the code (line 298), so this isn't causing the current garbage output, but it will be a problem when re-enabled.

### 3. Weight Values Look OK ✅

```
attn_q_weight[0:10]: -0.0011 -0.0029 0.0074 0.0088 0.0023 -0.0045 0.0033 -0.0008 0.0107 -0.0024
```

Range: ~0.001 to 0.01 ✅ (reasonable for FP16 weights)

## Debug Output Analysis

### Token Generation Pattern

**First 10 tokens**:
```
[0] ID= 25156 → "Ġseparately"
[1] ID=141034 → "ĠLá»ĭch"      ← Starts repeating
[2] ID=141034 → "ĠLá»ĭch"
[3] ID=141034 → "ĠLá»ĭch"
[4] ID=141034 → "ĠLá»ĭch"
[5] ID=141034 → "ĠLá»ĭch"
[6] ID=141034 → "ĠLá»ĭch"
[7] ID= 64362 → "ĠKw"          ← Switches to different token
[8] ID= 64362 → "ĠKw"
[9] ID= 64362 → "ĠKw"
```

**Observation**: Model gets stuck in repetitive loops, suggesting:
- Attention is not properly attending to context
- KV cache might not be working correctly
- Logits distribution is collapsing

### Attention Output Values

```
Layer 0, pos=0:
  Attention output[0:10]: 0.0182 -0.0056 -0.0002 -0.0258 -0.0089 -0.0017 -0.0065 0.0315 -0.0245 -0.0162

Layer 0, pos=1:
  Attention output[0:10]: 0.0179 -0.0060 0.0001 -0.0258 -0.0087 -0.0016 -0.0066 0.0315 -0.0247 -0.0162
```

**Problem**: Attention outputs are **nearly identical** across positions!

This suggests:
- Attention is not learning from context
- All positions are getting similar attention weights
- RoPE might not be working correctly

---

## Next Investigation Steps

### Priority 1: Check Attention Weights 🔴

The attention output being nearly identical across positions is suspicious.

**Add debug code to check attention scores**:
```cpp
// In cuda/kernels/gqa_attention.cu, after softmax
if (batch == 0 && q_head == 0 && pos < 3) {
    printf("Attention weights at pos=%u: ", pos);
    for (int i = 0; i <= pos && i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%.4f ", attn_weights[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

**Expected**: Weights should vary across positions  
**If broken**: All weights will be uniform (e.g., all 0.333 for 3 positions)

### Priority 2: Verify RoPE is Working 🟡

Check if Q/K values change after RoPE:

```
Q before RoPE[0:10]: 0.0078 -0.1409 -0.1265 -0.2659 0.0780 -0.0459 -0.0914 0.0322 -0.1941 -0.1295
Q after RoPE[0:10]:  0.0575  0.1143 -0.0049 -0.0847 -0.0061  0.0410 -0.0159 -0.0193  0.0582 -0.0973
```

Values **do change**, so RoPE is applying some transformation. But is it correct?

**TODO**: Compare RoPE output with llama.cpp for the same input.

### Priority 3: Check KV Cache 🟡

Verify that KV cache is being read/written correctly:

```
[KV CACHE VERIFY] Layer 0, pos=0, kv_head=0
  K_cache[pos=0][0:10]: -0.1893 -0.1949 -0.1465 -0.1093 -0.1279 0.1176 0.0701 0.2966 -0.0491 -0.1886
  V_cache[pos=0][0:10]: 0.0059 -0.0154 -0.0180 -0.0225 -0.0224 0.0052 -0.0112 0.0098 0.0159 -0.0286
```

Cache is being written. **TODO**: Verify it's being read correctly during attention.

### Priority 4: Compare with llama.cpp 🟢

Run llama.cpp with the same prompt and compare:
- Q values after projection
- K values after projection  
- Attention scores
- Attention weights after softmax
- Final logits

## Hypothesis: Attention Mechanism is Broken

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ Q values are now correct (matrix fix worked)
2. ✅ Weight values look reasonable
3. ❌ Attention output is nearly identical across positions
4. ❌ Model produces repetitive tokens
5. ❌ Output doesn't vary with context

**Most likely cause**: 
- Attention scores/weights are uniform (not learning from context)
- This could be due to:
  - Incorrect attention score calculation (Q·K^T)
  - Incorrect softmax scaling
  - RoPE not applying position information correctly
  - KV cache not being used during attention computation

---

## Action Items

1. **Add attention weight debugging** to see if weights are uniform
2. **Compare RoPE output** with llama.cpp for same input
3. **Verify KV cache usage** in attention kernel
4. **Check softmax scaling** - should be `1/sqrt(head_dim)` = `1/sqrt(64)` = `0.125`
5. **Investigate bias loading** - why are some values so large?

---

## Files to Check

1. `cuda/kernels/gqa_attention.cu` - Attention score calculation, softmax
2. `cuda/kernels/rope.cu` - RoPE implementation
3. `cuda/src/model/qwen_weight_loader.cpp` - Bias loading (quantization issue?)

---

## Success Criteria

The fix will be complete when:
1. ✅ Q values match llama.cpp (DONE)
2. ❌ Attention weights vary across positions (TODO)
3. ❌ Model generates diverse, non-repetitive tokens (TODO)
4. ❌ Output is coherent and follows prompt (TODO)
