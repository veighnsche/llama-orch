## Test Results Analysis

### What The Test Showed

**Output**:
```
Ġseparately(epochawsĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKwĠKw...
```

**Debug Info**:
```
[0] ID= 25156 → "Ġseparately"
[1] ID= 61290 → "(epoch"
[2] ID=  8635 → "aws"
[3] ID= 64362 → "ĠKw"
[4] ID= 64362 → "ĠKw"
[5] ID= 64362 → "ĠKw"
...
```

### 🔥 CRITICAL OBSERVATION

**The first 3 tokens are DIFFERENT!**
- Token 0: "Ġseparately" (ID 25156)
- Token 1: "(epoch" (ID 61290)
- Token 2: "aws" (ID 8635)
- Token 3+: "ĠKw" (ID 64362) **REPEATED**

**This means**:
- ✅ The model CAN generate different tokens initially
- ❌ Something breaks after token 3
- ⚠️ The bug is position-dependent!

---

## New Hypothesis

### The Bug Is In KV Cache or Position Handling

The fact that it works for 3 tokens then breaks suggests:

### Possibility 1: KV Cache Corruption
- First 3 tokens: Cache is small, works correctly
- Token 4+: Cache reading/writing breaks
- Corrupted cache causes attention to always produce same output

### Possibility 2: Position Counter Bug
- First 3 tokens: Position is tracked correctly (0, 1, 2)
- Token 4+: Position counter breaks or overflows
- Wrong position causes RoPE to apply wrong rotations

### Possibility 3: Cache Overflow
- Cache has a size limit or indexing issue
- After position 3, we start writing to wrong memory
- Reading corrupted cache causes repetitive output

---

## Debug Output Clues

### Attention Weights Look Good
```
cache_len=0: weights [0]=1.0000 (only 1 position)
cache_len=1: weights [0]=0.5000 [1]=0.5000 (2 positions)
cache_len=2: weights [0]=0.3333 [1]=0.3333 [2]=0.3333 (3 positions)
cache_len=3: weights [0]=0.2500 [1]=0.2500 [2]=0.2500 [3]=0.2500 (4 positions)
cache_len=4: weights [0]=0.2387 [1]=0.1988 [2]=0.1190 [3]=0.2270 [4]=0.2165 (5 positions)
```

Wait! Look at this pattern:
- cache_len=0-3: Weights are nearly UNIFORM (all equal or very close)
- cache_len=4: Weights finally start to VARY

**This is suspicious!** Why are the first 4 tokens producing uniform attention weights?

---

## New Theory: Attention Is Broken

### The Pattern

For the first 4 tokens, attention weights are nearly uniform:
- Position 0: All attention on itself (1.0)
- Position 1: Equal attention (0.5, 0.5)
- Position 2: Equal attention (0.33, 0.33, 0.33)
- Position 3: Equal attention (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)

**This means attention is NOT learning from context!**

All positions are getting equal weight, which means:
- Q·K scores are all the same
- The model can't distinguish between positions
- It's essentially averaging all previous tokens

### Why This Causes Repetitive Tokens

If attention can't distinguish positions:
1. All previous context is averaged equally
2. The model loses track of what it just generated
3. It falls into a repetitive pattern
4. After a few tokens, it gets stuck on one token

---

## Root Cause: RoPE or Attention

The uniform attention weights suggest:

### Option A: RoPE Is Broken
- RoPE should make Q and K position-dependent
- If RoPE doesn't work, all Q·K scores would be similar
- This would cause uniform attention weights

### Option B: Attention Score Computation Is Broken
- Q·K computation might be wrong
- Scores might not be varying with position
- This would cause uniform attention weights

---

## What To Investigate Next

### 1. Check RoPE Output
Add debug prints after RoPE:
```cuda
// After RoPE
printf("Q_after_rope[0:5]: %.4f, %.4f, %.4f, %.4f, %.4f\n", ...);
printf("K_after_rope[0:5]: %.4f, %.4f, %.4f, %.4f, %.4f\n", ...);
```

Verify that Q and K are actually being rotated differently for different positions.

### 2. Check Q·K Scores Before Softmax
Add debug prints in attention kernel:
```cuda
// Before softmax
printf("Raw Q·K scores: [0]=%.4f [1]=%.4f [2]=%.4f [3]=%.4f\n", ...);
```

Verify that scores are varying, not all the same.

### 3. Check Position Parameter
Verify that `pos` is incrementing correctly:
```cuda
printf("Current position: %u\n", pos);
```

## My Mistake (Again)

I jumped to conclusions about `ffn_down` without carefully analyzing the symptoms.

The clue was there all along:
- **First 3 tokens work**
- **Then it breaks**

This is a classic KV cache or position bug, not a weight loading bug.

---

## Status

### What I Fixed
✅ Added missing `ffn_down` line (good to have, but not THE bug)

### What's Still Broken
❌ Model generates repetitive tokens after 3-4 tokens
❌ Attention weights are too uniform for first few positions
❌ The real bug is still unknown

### Next Investigation
🔍 Focus on RoPE and attention score computation
