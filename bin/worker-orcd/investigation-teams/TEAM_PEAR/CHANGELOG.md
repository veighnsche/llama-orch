## 2025-10-07T10:16Z — Phase 1 Complete

**Action:** Peer-reviewed tokenization & embedding pipeline (9 claims)

**Claims Verified:** 9 / 9
- Team Blue: Special token fix (151644/151645)
- Team Purple: Vocab size, embeddings, format verification
- 4 false leads confirmed (token IDs, embeddings, format)

**Fines Assessed:** €0 (all teams provided proper evidence)

**Files Created:**
- `TEAM_PEAR/PHASE1_TOKENIZATION_REPORT.md` (complete peer review)

**Key Findings:**
- All tokenization claims properly documented
- Teams self-corrected quickly when hypotheses disproven
- Clear evidence trail for all claims
- No comment updates needed (existing comments accurate)

**Status:** Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready

## 2025-10-07T10:26Z — Phase 2 Complete

**Action:** Peer-reviewed cuBLAS matrix multiplication correctness (8 claims)

**Claims Verified:** 8 / 8
- Team Charlie: lm_head manual verification (9 test positions)
- Team Felicia: CUBLAS_OP_T experiment (stuck repetition)
- Team Aurora: CUBLAS_OP_T with corrected lda (confirmed failure)
- Team THIMBLE: Pre-transpose experiment (stride hypothesis disproven)
- Team ORION: Q[0] correct, Q[95]/Q[126] anomaly discovered
- Team TOP HAT: All standard hypotheses eliminated
- Team BATTLESHIP: Q spikes proven harmless (filtered by attention)

**Fines Assessed:** €15 (ORION missing evidence link for Q weight dump)

**Files Created:**
- `TEAM_PEAR/PHASE2_CUBLAS_REPORT.md` (comprehensive peer review)

**Key Findings:**
- cuBLAS lm_head projection verified correct (Charlie)
- CUBLAS_OP_T approach definitively wrong (Felicia, Aurora)
- Q[95]/Q[126] anomaly real but harmless (ORION, THIMBLE, TOP HAT, BATTLESHIP)
- Excellent scientific process: multiple teams, independent replication
- BATTLESHIP's breakthrough: Q spikes filtered by attention softmax (1000x reduction)

**Pattern Identified:**
- Multiple teams (ORION, THIMBLE, TOP HAT) spent ~3 hours investigating Q anomaly
- BATTLESHIP's downstream test immediately showed impact was negligible
- **Lesson:** Test downstream impact before deep-diving into anomalies

**Status:** Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 ready
