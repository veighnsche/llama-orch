## Phase 1: Tokenization & Embedding Pipeline ⚠️ MAJOR ISSUES FOUND

**Claims Reviewed:** 9  
**Verified:** 0  
**Falsified:** 1  
**Needs Evidence:** 8  
**Fines Issued:** €500

### Summary (SKEPTICAL RE-REVIEW)
**CRITICAL FINDINGS:** Multiple claims based on non-existent files, hardcoded values, and code comments rather than empirical evidence. Test bypasses special tokens entirely while claiming "tokenization is correct."

**Key Issues:**
1. ❌ Vocab size 151936 appears hardcoded in tests, not from GGUF metadata
2. ❌ Token IDs 151644/151645 are magic numbers without tokenizer vocab dump
3. ❌ Embedding values only exist in comments, never dumped from VRAM
4. ❌ Test uses `use_chat_template = false` bypassing special tokens
5. ❌ Reference file `.archive/llama_cpp_debug.log` does not exist

**Evidence:** 
- `reports/phase1_EVIDENCE.md` (initial review)
- `reports/phase1_SKEPTICAL_FINDINGS.md` (skeptical re-review with fines)

## Phase 2: cuBLAS Matrix Multiplication ✅ COMPLETE (CORRECTED)

**Claims Reviewed:** 3  
**Verified:** 0  
**Falsified:** 0  
**Needs Evidence:** 3  
**Fines Issued:** €200

### Summary (CORRECTED APPROACH)
**KEY LESSON:** Don't complain "output is garbage" - we know that! Focus on evidence gaps.

**Real Issues Found:**
1. ❌ Only 0.11% verification coverage (1 element out of 896)
2. ❌ No side-by-side parameter comparison (Sentinel vs Felicia/Aurora)
3. ❌ Sparse manual verification (4 positions out of 151936)

**Evidence:** 
- `reports/phase2_SKEPTICAL_FINDINGS.md` (corrected)
- Code stamp in `qwen_transformer.cpp`
