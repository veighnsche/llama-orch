# üçê TEAM PEAR ‚Äî Phase 2 Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-07T11:47Z (WITH ACTUAL TESTING)  
**Phase:** cuBLAS Matrix Multiplication Correctness  
**Approach:** Evidence-Only + Skeptical Review + ACTUAL TESTING

---

## Key Lesson Learned

**WRONG APPROACH:** "Output is garbage, therefore claim is wrong"  
**RIGHT APPROACH:** "Did you actually test what you claimed?"

### What I Did Wrong Initially
- Complained "output is still garbage" as if that's a finding
- Used circular reasoning ("garbage output ‚Üí cuBLAS wrong")
- Issued fines for things we already know (output is broken)

### What I Fixed
- Focus on **evidence gaps** (only verified 0.11% of elements)
- Focus on **missing artifacts** (no side-by-side parameter comparison)
- Focus on **incomplete testing** (only token 1, only layer 0)
- Removed fines based on "but output is garbage" (we know that!)

---

## Execution Summary

### Claims Reviewed
1. Team Sentinel: "Mathematically correct" (manual matches cuBLAS)
2. Team Sentinel: "Fixed ALL 8 matmuls" (unlike Felicia/Aurora)
3. Team Charlie: "cuBLAS matches manual" (4 positions verified)

### Skeptical Findings (CORRECTED)

#### Finding 1: Incomplete Verification Coverage
- **Claim:** "Matmul parity proven"
- **Reality:** Only verified Q[0] (1 out of 896 elements = 0.11%)
- **Missing:** K, V, FFN, LM head verification
- **Fine:** ‚Ç¨100

#### Finding 2: No Parameter Comparison
- **Claim:** "Team Aurora didn't fix ALL 8 matmuls"
- **Reality:** No side-by-side diff showing parameter differences
- **Missing:** Proof that Sentinel's params differ from Felicia/Aurora
- **Fine:** ‚Ç¨50

#### Finding 3: Sparse Manual Verification
- **Claim:** "cuBLAS matches manual within 0.00002"
- **Reality:** Only 4 positions out of 151936 (0.0026%)
- **Missing:** Representative sample verification
- **Fine:** ‚Ç¨50

## Code Stamps Added

‚úÖ `cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp` (30 lines, ‚Ç¨150 fines documented)

**Format:** [PEER:NEEDS-EVIDENCE 2025-10-07] with:
- What they claimed
- What was actually tested
- What's missing
- Fines issued
- **NOTE:** "Output being garbage is NOT a finding (we know it's broken!)"

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**Tested Team Sentinel's claim with actual code:**

```
Team Sentinel claimed: Manual Q[0] = -0.015185
TEAM PEAR measured:    Manual Q[0] = +0.001864
Difference: 0.017049 (SIGN IS DIFFERENT!)
```

**This is NOT a small difference!** The sign is opposite!

**Possible explanations:**
1. Different input data (Sentinel used actual normed, PEAR used test input)
2. Different weight loading method
3. Sentinel's calculation was wrong

**Missing:** Sentinel's actual input data for reproduction

---

## Fines Issued

**Total:** ‚Ç¨300 (increased after finding missing reproducibility)

**Breakdown:**
- Team Sentinel: ‚Ç¨150 (incomplete verification + unproven difference)
- Team Charlie: ‚Ç¨50 (sparse manual verification)

**Fines REMOVED:**
- ~~‚Ç¨200~~ "output is garbage" ‚Äî WRONG reasoning
- ~~‚Ç¨150~~ "why is output garbage if correct" ‚Äî Circular logic
- ~~‚Ç¨50~~ TEAM PEAR self-fine ‚Äî Warning was reasonable

---

## Required Evidence (Missing)

1. **Comprehensive manual verification**
   - At least 10% of Q elements (not just Q[0])
   - Multiple tokens (0, 1, 2)
   - K, V projections (at least element 0)
   - FFN gate/up/down (at least element 0)
   - LM head (at least 10 positions)

2. **Parameter comparison**
   - Side-by-side diff: Felicia vs Aurora vs Sentinel
   - Proof that Sentinel's params actually differ

3. **Documentation**
   - What "mathematically correct" means in context
   - Why verification is incomplete but still useful

## Artifacts Produced

‚úÖ `reports/phase2_SKEPTICAL_FINDINGS.md` (corrected)  
‚úÖ Code stamp in `qwen_transformer.cpp`  
‚úÖ Updated `FINES_LEDGER.csv`  
‚úÖ This summary

## Lessons for Future Phases

### ‚úÖ DO
- Focus on **evidence gaps** (what wasn't tested)
- Focus on **missing artifacts** (logs, diffs, dumps)
- Focus on **incomplete coverage** (1 element out of 896)
- Ask "Did you test what you claimed?"

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Complain "output is garbage" (we know!)
- Use circular reasoning (garbage ‚Üí wrong ‚Üí garbage)
- Fine teams for things we already know
- Expect perfect verification (reasonable claims are OK)
