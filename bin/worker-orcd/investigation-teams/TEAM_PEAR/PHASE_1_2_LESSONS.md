## Key Lessons

### 1. DON'T Complain "Output is Garbage"
**WRONG:** "Output is garbage, therefore claim is wrong"  
**RIGHT:** "Did you test what you claimed? Where's the evidence?"

**Why:** We KNOW output is garbage. That's the baseline. It's not a finding.

### 2. LOOK for Tools FIRST, Then BUILD
**WRONG:** "I'm blocked, no parser available"  
**RIGHT:** "Let me search for existing parsers... Found! Let me use it."

**Phase 2 Example:**
- Initially claimed "BLOCKED: No GGUF parser"
- Actually found: `worker_gguf::GGUFMetadata::parse_tensors`
- Built test in 10 minutes

### 3. RUN ACTUAL TESTS, Don't Just Read
**WRONG:** Accept Team Sentinel's claim: "Manual Q[0] = -0.015185"  
**RIGHT:** Build test, run it, get: "Manual Q[0] = +0.001864" ‚Üí MISMATCH!

**Result:** Found real evidence of problem (sign is different!)

### 4. Focus on Evidence Gaps, Not Outcomes
**WRONG:** "Only verified Q[0] but output is garbage"  
**RIGHT:** "Only verified Q[0] (0.11% coverage), need more comprehensive testing"

**Why:** Coverage is measurable, "garbage output" is not actionable.

## Phase 1 Results

**Fines:** ‚Ç¨500  
**Key Finding:** Test bypasses special tokens (use_chat_template=false)  
**Artifacts:** Test logs, token dumps, vocab checks

**What Worked:**
- ‚úÖ Ran haiku test
- ‚úÖ Extracted token texts
- ‚úÖ Documented missing evidence

**What Didn't:**
- ‚ùå Initially just read documents
- ‚ùå Complained about garbage output
- ‚ùå Didn't test enough

---

## Phase 2 Results

**Fines:** ‚Ç¨300  
**Key Finding:** Cannot reproduce Sentinel's manual Q[0] (-0.015185 vs +0.001864)  
**Artifacts:** Test code (`tests/verify_manual_q0.rs`), logs showing mismatch

**What Worked:**
- ‚úÖ Found existing GGUF parser
- ‚úÖ Built manual verification test
- ‚úÖ Ran test and found MISMATCH
- ‚úÖ Produced real evidence

**What Didn't:**
- ‚ùå Initially claimed "BLOCKED"
- ‚ùå Didn't look for tools first
- ‚ùå Wasted time complaining about garbage output

## Phase 3 Approach

**LEARNED:** LOOK ‚Üí BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí DOCUMENT

1. ‚úÖ Search for existing KV cache tests
2. ‚úÖ Found comprehensive test suite (30 tests)
3. ‚è≥ Running tests
4. ‚è≥ Analyze results
5. ‚è≥ Stamp code with findings

**NO BLOCKERS** ‚Äî Found existing infrastructure!

## Updated Mission Rules

### NEVER BE BLOCKED
**Before claiming "BLOCKED":**
1. ‚úÖ LOOK for existing tools/infrastructure
2. ‚úÖ Search codebase for parsers, loaders, utilities
3. ‚úÖ BUILD the tool yourself if needed
4. ‚úÖ Use existing code as examples
5. ‚úÖ EXHAUST ALL OPTIONS

**Only claim BLOCKED if:**
- Hardware not available
- External dependencies truly missing
- User permission required

**NEVER claim blocked for:**
- ‚ùå "No parser" ‚Äî BUILD ONE
- ‚ùå "No numpy" ‚Äî Use Rust
- ‚ùå "No infrastructure" ‚Äî LOOK FIRST
- ‚ùå "Too hard" ‚Äî FIGURE IT OUT

## Fines Summary

**Phase 1:** ‚Ç¨500
- Team Purple: ‚Ç¨250
- Team Blue: ‚Ç¨100
- Team Blue+Purple: ‚Ç¨150

**Phase 2:** ‚Ç¨300
- Team Sentinel: ‚Ç¨200 (incomplete verification + missing reproducibility)
- Team Charlie: ‚Ç¨100

**Total:** ‚Ç¨800

## Next Phases

**Phase 3:** KV Cache (running tests now)  
**Phase 4:** RoPE/RMSNorm  
**Phase 5:** Attention Mechanism  
**Phase 6:** FFN Path  
**Phase 7:** Sampling & Generation  
**Phase 8:** Weight Loading  
**Phase 9:** Infrastructure & Edge Cases  
**Phase 10:** Contradictions & Final Synthesis

**Approach:** LOOK ‚Üí BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí DOCUMENT (NO BLOCKERS!)
