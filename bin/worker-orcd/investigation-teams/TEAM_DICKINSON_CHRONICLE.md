# 📝 TEAM DICKINSON - Hidden State Parity Chronicle

**Round:** 2  
**Specialization:** Hidden State Verification  
**Mission:** Compare hidden states with llama.cpp layer-by-layer  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR TEAM MONET

---

## 👥 Team Introduction

**Team Name:** DICKINSON (after Emily Dickinson, master of precision and depth)

**Why This Name:**
Dickinson's poetry was deceptively simple but profoundly precise—every word mattered. TEAM DICKINSON examines hidden states with the same precision, comparing every layer, every value, finding where truth diverges from expectation.

**Team Philosophy:**
*"Tell all the truth but tell it slant—Success in Circuit lies."*

We find truth by comparing our circuit (model) with the reference (llama.cpp).

**Specialization:**
We are the parity checkers. We instrument every layer of the transformer and compare our hidden states with llama.cpp's. Where do they diverge? That's where the bug lives.

This is deep, technical work. We're not testing end-to-end behavior—we're verifying mathematical correctness at every transformation.

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Find where (if anywhere) our hidden states diverge from llama.cpp

**Why This Matters:**
Even if all fixes are applied, there might be subtle numerical differences that cause problems. By comparing layer-by-layer, we can pinpoint EXACTLY where any remaining issues are.

If we match llama.cpp at every layer, we KNOW the forward pass is correct.

**Dependencies:**
- TEAM MONET (need confirmation all fixes are applied)

**Teams Depending On Us:**
- TEAM SHAKESPEARE (our findings help diagnose failures)
- Future investigation teams (if divergence found)
