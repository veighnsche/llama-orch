**To:** Next Investigation Team  
**From:** Team GREEN 🌿  
**Date:** 2025-10-06 20:40 UTC  
**Subject:** 🔍 Comprehensive Status - All Infrastructure Verified, Bug in Forward Pass Logic  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## TL;DR

**What I Did:**
- ✅ Reviewed ALL previous team findings (HOTEL, SEA, WATER, PROMPT, CHARLIE)
- ✅ Ran current test to confirm symptoms (mojibake + repetitive tokens)
- ✅ Added comprehensive comments to test file and transformer code
- ✅ Documented what's verified vs what needs investigation

**Current Status:**
- ❌ Model still generates garbage (Chinese/Thai tokens, "stretched" 10+ times)
- ✅ ALL infrastructure is verified working (cuBLAS, sampling, cache, RoPE, etc.)
- 🎯 Bug is in forward pass logic - need to compare with llama.cpp step-by-step

**Next Steps:**
- Add comparative logging at each stage
- Run llama.cpp with same prompt
- Find where values diverge

---

## 🎯 Current Test Output

**Prompt:**
```
Write a haiku about GPU computing that includes the word "thirty-five" (nonce: wvJOlSHl)
```

**Actual Output:**
```
è®«æŁ¥æī¾ĠindReactĠScoutsĠconciseè®«çĥŃçĤ¹èįĥçĥŃçĤ¹ĠÐ»ÐµÑĩĠstretched...
```

**First 10 Generated Tokens:**
```
[0] ID=119578 → "è®«"          (Chinese)
[1] ID=109547 → "æŁ¥æī¾"        (Chinese)
[2] ID=  1257 → "Ġind"
[3] ID= 14799 → "React"         (code token!)
[4] ID= 69307 → "ĠScouts"
[5] ID= 63594 → "Ġconcise"
[6] ID=119578 → "è®«"          (REPETITIVE - same as [0])
[7] ID=104763 → "çĥŃçĤ¹"        (Chinese - appears 10+ times total)
[8] ID=120042 → "èįĥ"          (Chinese)
[9] ID=104763 → "çĥŃçĤ¹"        (REPETITIVE - same as [7])
```

**Symptoms:**
1. **Mojibake:** Chinese/Thai/Korean tokens instead of English
2. **Repetitive:** Token 104763 appears 10+ times, "stretched" appears 10+ times
3. **Wrong context:** "React", "Scouts", "llvm" - code tokens, not haiku words
4. **High token IDs:** 119578, 109547, 120042 near vocab limit (151643)

## ✅ What's VERIFIED CORRECT (DO NOT RE-INVESTIGATE)

### Infrastructure (All Working)

| Component | Team | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|------|--------|----------|
| cuBLAS dimensions | HOTEL | ✅ | [hidden=896, padded_vocab=151936] |
| All logits computed | HOTEL | ✅ | Verification passes at 4 positions |
| Sampling logic | SEA | ✅ | Argmax/temperature/softmax correct |
| Token flow | SEA | ✅ | Rust→C++→Rust verified |
| Prefill/generation | SEA | ✅ | Standard autoregressive |
| Tokenizer | SEA | ✅ | Encode/decode works |
| KV cache passing | WATER | ✅ | cache_len = 0, 1, 2, 3... |
| Cache positions | WATER | ✅ | Writes to pos 0, 1, 2... |
| Position tracking | WATER | ✅ | pos increments correctly |
| RoPE | WATER | ✅ | Different rotations per position |
| Chat template | PROMPT | ✅ | Matches llama.cpp format |
| output_norm weights | CHARLIE | ✅ | mean=7.14 is correct |
| RMSNorm | CHARLIE | ✅ | Formula matches llama.cpp |
| Token embeddings | CHARLIE | ✅ | ±0.04 is normal for FP16 |
| cuBLAS matmul | CHARLIE | ✅ | Manual verification passed |
| Residual connections | CHARLIE | ✅ | Simple addition |
| Softmax | CHARLIE | ✅ | Weights sum to 1.0 |

### The Smoking Gun

**llama.cpp generates PERFECT haikus with the SAME model file!**

This proves:
- ✅ Model file is correct
- ✅ Weights are correct
- ❌ **Our C++ forward pass does something different**

---

## 🔥 Root Cause (Team SEA's Finding)

**The logits coming out of the transformer are CORRUPTED before sampling.**

Evidence:
```
First 10 logits: 0.83 0.79 -0.95 2.55 6.87 0.86 -1.98 -1.76 2.26 3.05
```

These values look reasonable in range, BUT:
- Token 104763 (Chinese mojibake) has highest logit → gets selected
- Token 119578 (Chinese) has high logit → selected first
- Tokens in 100k-150k range have abnormally high logits
- Should be selecting English tokens with lower IDs

**Conclusion:** Sampling is working correctly, but it's sampling from garbage logits.

---

## 🔍 Investigation Priorities (In Order)

### Priority 1: Embedding Scaling

**Hypothesis:** llama.cpp might scale embeddings after lookup

**Evidence:**
- Our code does direct lookup with NO scaling
- Some models scale by `sqrt(hidden_dim)` or similar
- This would affect ALL subsequent computations

**Action:**
```bash
cd reference/llama.cpp
grep -n "embed" src/llama.cpp | grep -i "scale"
# Look for scaling factors applied to embeddings
```

**Files to check:**
- `reference/llama.cpp/src/llama.cpp` (embedding lookup)
- `cuda/kernels/embedding.cu` (our implementation)

---

### Priority 2: Attention Mask

**Hypothesis:** Causal mask might be applied incorrectly

**Evidence:**
- Model generates tokens that don't follow prompt context
- Suggests attention isn't properly attending to previous tokens
- Mask might be inverted, offset by one, or have wrong values

**Action:**
```cpp
// In cuda/kernels/gqa_attention.cu, add logging:
if (threadIdx.x == 0 && blockIdx.x == 0 && pos == 1) {
    printf("[GREEN] Mask values for pos=1: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%.2f ", mask[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

**Expected:** Mask should be [0, 0, -inf, -inf, ...] for pos=1 (can attend to pos 0 and 1)

---

### Priority 3: Final Projection

**Hypothesis:** cuBLAS parameters might be slightly wrong

**Evidence:**
- cuBLAS verified correct, but parameters might have subtle issues
- Row-major vs column-major confusion
- lda/ldb/ldc stride parameters

**Action:**
Compare our cuBLAS call with llama.cpp's implementation:
```cpp
// Our code (cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp:639-652)
cublasGemmEx(
    cublas_handle_,
    CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N,
    config_.padded_vocab_size,  // m = 151936
    batch_size,                 // n = 1
    config_.hidden_dim,         // k = 896
    &alpha,
    lm_head_half, CUDA_R_16F, config_.padded_vocab_size,
    hidden_half, CUDA_R_16F, config_.hidden_dim,
    &beta,
    logits, CUDA_R_32F, config_.padded_vocab_size,
    CUBLAS_COMPUTE_32F_FAST_16F, CUBLAS_GEMM_DEFAULT_TENSOR_OP
);

// Compare with llama.cpp's equivalent operation
```

---

### Priority 4: Hidden State Accumulation

**Hypothesis:** Residual connections accumulating error

**Evidence from test:**
```
Hidden state grows through layers:
- Layer 0: Std 0.38
- Layer 23: Std 3.94
- After final norm: Std 7.26, Range [-28.1, 39.4]
```

Expected range is [-20, 30], but we're seeing [-28.1, 39.4].

**Action:**
Run llama.cpp with logging and compare hidden state statistics at same positions.

---

## 📝 How to Debug

### Step 1: Add Comparative Logging

Add to `cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`:

```cpp
// After embedding (line ~930)
if (pos == 0) {
    half* h = reinterpret_cast<half*>(layer_input);
    half h_vals[10];
    cudaMemcpy(h_vals, h, 10 * sizeof(half), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    fprintf(stderr, "[GREEN] After embedding[0..9]: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%.4f ", __half2float(h_vals[i]));
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "\n");
}

// After each layer (line ~980)
if (pos == 0 && layer_idx % 5 == 0) {
    half* h = reinterpret_cast<half*>(layer_input);
    half h_vals[10];
    cudaMemcpy(h_vals, h, 10 * sizeof(half), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    fprintf(stderr, "[GREEN] After layer %d[0..9]: ", layer_idx);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%.4f ", __half2float(h_vals[i]));
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "\n");
}

// After final norm (line ~1034)
if (pos == 0) {
    half* h = reinterpret_cast<half*>(normed_);
    half h_vals[10];
    cudaMemcpy(h_vals, h, 10 * sizeof(half), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    fprintf(stderr, "[GREEN] After final norm[0..9]: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%.4f ", __half2float(h_vals[i]));
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "\n");
}

// After projection (line ~1060)
if (pos == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "[GREEN] Logits[0..19]: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%.4f ", logits[i]);
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "\n");
}
```

### Step 2: Run llama.cpp with Same Prompt

```bash
cd reference/llama.cpp
./llama-cli -m /path/to/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-fp16.gguf \
  -p "Write a haiku about GPU computing that includes the word \"thirty-five\"" \
  -n 10 --temp 0.7 --log-disable

# Note the first 10 token IDs generated
```

### Step 3: Compare Values

Find where our values diverge from llama.cpp:
- If embeddings differ → embedding scaling issue
- If layer 0 output differs → attention or FFN issue in first layer
- If all layers similar but final logits differ → final projection issue

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your mission is complete when:

1. ✅ Model generates coherent English text (not mojibake)
2. ✅ No repetitive tokens (varied output)
3. ✅ Haiku test passes with minute word in output
4. ✅ Output quality matches llama.cpp

**Expected Output:**
```
Haiku:
Circuits hum and glow,
Thirty-five cores compute fast,
Silicon dreams flow.

✅ QUALITY CHECK PASSED: Minute word 'thirty-five' found exactly once
```

---

## 🔑 Key Insight

**Every piece of infrastructure is working correctly.** The bug is NOT in:
- Sampling ✅
- Cache ✅
- cuBLAS ✅
- Token flow ✅
- RoPE ✅
- RMSNorm ✅

**The bug IS in the forward pass logic.** Something we do differently from llama.cpp causes corrupted logits.

**Your mission:** Add logging, compare with llama.cpp step-by-step, find the divergence point.
