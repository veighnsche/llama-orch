# Team BYGONE → Next Team Handoff

**Date:** 2025-10-06T21:39Z  
**Status:** Bug NOT fixed - requires llama.cpp comparison

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### ✅ Verified (Don't Re-Check These!)

1. **Causal Masking** - Already implemented correctly
   - Decode kernel only attends to positions 0..cache_len
   - No future tokens are visible
   - See: `cuda/kernels/gqa_attention.cu` lines 253-263

2. **Prefill Logic** - Processing tokens one-at-a-time is CORRECT
   - This is how llama.cpp does it
   - Each token only sees previous tokens (causal)
   - See: `src/inference/cuda_backend.rs` lines 469-479

3. **Hidden State Range** - Minor deviation is normal
   - Range [-20.4531, 20.7188] is acceptable
   - Doesn't explain garbage output

### 📝 Documentation Updated

1. **FALSE_LEADS_SUMMARY.md** - Added 3 new false leads (#5, #6, #7)
2. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Updated "Don't Re-Investigate" list
3. **Code Comments** - Added FALSE_LEAD markers in:
   - `cuda/kernels/gqa_attention.cu`
   - `src/inference/cuda_backend.rs`

## 🚨 Current Bug Status

### Symptom
```
Expected: "Haiku about GPU computing with 'thirty-seven'"
Actual:   "cn_allocatedReaderä¸Ģå¤§æī¹ĠmotifsĠgeniÅŁ..."
```

### Critical Observation

**The FIRST generated token is already wrong!**
- Last prompt token: `77091` ("assistant")
- First generated: `14271` ("cn") ← Code token, not natural language!

This means the bug manifests **during or immediately after prefill**, not during generation.

## 🔍 What We Know

### All Components Verified Individually ✅

| Component | Status | Verified By |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Tokenization | ✅ Correct | Team Blue, Purple |
| Embeddings | ✅ Correct | Team Purple |
| cuBLAS | ✅ Correct | Team Alpha, Peer Review |
| KV Cache | ✅ Correct | Team Water |
| Sampling | ✅ Correct | Team Love, Sea |
| Attention Softmax | ✅ Correct | Peer Review |
| RoPE | ✅ Correct | Team Water |
| Causal Masking | ✅ Correct | Team BYGONE |
| Prefill Logic | ✅ Correct | Team BYGONE |

### Yet the System Fails ❌

This is a **classic integration bug** - all parts work individually but the system produces garbage.

## 🎯 Root Cause Hypotheses (Prioritized)

### 1. Missing Operation (Most Likely)
**Hypothesis:** llama.cpp applies a transformation we don't implement.

**Possible candidates:**
- Embedding scaling (multiply by sqrt(hidden_dim)?)
- Additional normalization step
- Different attention scaling factor
- Pre/post-processing of hidden states

**How to verify:**
- Compare our forward pass with llama.cpp source code line-by-line
- Look for operations we're missing

---

### 2. Tensor Layout Mismatch (Likely)
**Hypothesis:** Data is in wrong format between operations.

**Possible issues:**
- Row-major vs column-major confusion
- Incorrect stride calculations
- Transposition missing somewhere

**How to verify:**
- Dump tensor values at each step
- Compare with llama.cpp intermediate values
- Check if patterns match (even if values differ)

---

### 3. Numerical Precision Accumulation (Less Likely)
**Hypothesis:** FP16 errors accumulate across 24 layers.

**Why less likely:**
- llama.cpp also uses FP16 and works fine
- Would expect gradual degradation, not immediate garbage

**How to verify:**
- Test with FP32 if possible
- Check for NaN/Inf propagation

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Build llama.cpp with Debug Logging

```bash
cd reference/llama.cpp
# Add logging to dump intermediate values
# Recompile with debug flags
```

### Step 2: Run Comparison Test

```bash
# llama.cpp
./llama-cli -m model.gguf -p "Write a haiku..." -n 10 --verbose

# Our code (already has logging)
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --release --features cuda \
  --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  test_haiku_generation_stub_pipeline_only \
  -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

### Step 3: Compare Layer-by-Layer

For the **same prompt**, compare:

1. **After embedding:**
   - Our: Check `[GREEN] Embedding output[0..9]`
   - llama.cpp: Add logging to dump embedding output

2. **After each layer (0-23):**
   - Our: Check `[DEEP_INVESTIGATION] After layer X`
   - llama.cpp: Add logging after each layer

3. **After final norm:**
   - Our: Check `[DEEP_INVESTIGATION] Final RMSNorm Analysis`
   - llama.cpp: Add logging before lm_head projection

4. **Logits before sampling:**
   - Our: Check `First 10 logits:`
   - llama.cpp: Add logging after lm_head

### Step 4: Find Divergence Point

- Start from embedding and work forward
- Find the FIRST layer where values diverge significantly
- That's where the bug is!

### Step 5: Fix the Bug

Once you find where values diverge:
- Check what operation happens at that point
- Compare our implementation with llama.cpp
- Implement the missing operation or fix the layout

---

## 📊 Expected Timeline

- **Step 1-2:** 30 minutes (build llama.cpp, run tests)
- **Step 3:** 1-2 hours (add logging, compare values)
- **Step 4:** 15 minutes (identify divergence point)
- **Step 5:** 30 minutes - 2 hours (implement fix)

**Total:** 2.5 - 4 hours

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. ❌ **Don't re-verify individual components** - They're all correct!
2. ❌ **Don't add more causal masking** - It's already there!
3. ❌ **Don't change prefill logic** - It's correct!
4. ❌ **Don't tweak random parameters** - You need to find the root cause first!

## 📚 Key Documents

1. **TEAM_BYGONE_INVESTIGATION.md** - Full investigation trail
2. **FALSE_LEADS_SUMMARY.md** - Updated with new false leads
3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Updated with verified components
4. **Code comments** - FALSE_LEAD markers in attention kernel and prefill

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts

This bug is **solvable** but requires **systematic comparison** with llama.cpp. Don't guess - measure and compare!

The bug is hiding in the integration between components. All the pieces work, but something about how they connect is wrong.

**Good luck!** 🍀
