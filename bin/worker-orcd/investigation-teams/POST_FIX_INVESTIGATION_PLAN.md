# üé® Post-Fix Investigation Plan - Specialized Teams

**Date:** 2025-10-07T13:59Z  
**Purpose:** Systematic re-validation of all components after bug fixes  
**Status:** üöÄ READY TO DEPLOY

---

## üéØ Mission Overview

**Context:** Multiple critical bugs have been fixed (softmax underflow, sampling order, cuBLAS parameters, corrupted weights, config overrides). Now we need to:

1. **Verify** which fixes are actually applied in current code
2. **Resolve** contradictions between team findings
3. **Re-test** components that were dismissed as "not the bug"
4. **Validate** end-to-end functionality

**Team Structure:** Each team is specialized in ONE unit of work. Teams are named after famous painters and poets.

   - [ ] Layer 23: diff = [value]
   - [ ] Output norm: diff = [value]
   - [ ] Logits: diff = [value]

5. **Identify Divergence Point**
   - [ ] First layer with significant diff (>0.01)?
   - [ ] Does diff accumulate over layers?
   - [ ] Or sudden spike at specific layer?

6. **Analyze Root Cause (if divergence found)**
   - [ ] Check cuBLAS parameters at divergence layer
   - [ ] Check RMSNorm at divergence layer
   - [ ] Check RoPE at divergence layer
   - [ ] Check attention at divergence layer

## üé® TEAM REMBRANDT - The Fix Restorer

**Specialization:** Reverted Fix Re-Application  
**Mission:** Re-apply fixes that were incorrectly reverted

### üì¶ Unit of Work: Reverted Fix Restoration

**Objective:** Identify and re-apply any fixes that were reverted but are actually correct

**Tasks:**

1. **Wait for TEAM PICASSO's Report**
   - [ ] If CUBLAS_OP_T is correct but currently CUBLAS_OP_N:
     - Re-apply CUBLAS_OP_T to all 8 matmuls
     - Use SENTINEL's lda values
     - Test and verify

2. **Wait for TEAM VAN GOGH's Report**
   - [ ] If weight normalization is correct but currently raw:
     - Apply normalization
     - Test and verify
   - [ ] If raw weights are correct but currently normalized:
     - Remove normalization
     - Test and verify

3. **Check for Other Reverted Fixes**
   ```bash
   # Search git history for reverted commits
   cd bin/worker-orcd
   git log --all --grep="revert" --oneline
   git log --all --grep="undo" --oneline
   git log --all --grep="rollback" --oneline
   ```
   
   **Document:**
   - [ ] List of reverted commits
   - [ ] Reason for revert
   - [ ] Should they be re-applied?

4. **Re-Apply Fixes (if needed)**
   - [ ] For each fix to restore:
     - Create new branch
     - Apply fix
     - Run tests
     - Document results
     - Merge if successful

5. **Verify No Regressions**
   ```bash
   # After re-applying fixes, run full test suite
   cargo test --features cuda --release
   ```
   
   **Document:**
   - [ ] All tests pass? ‚úÖ / ‚ùå
   - [ ] Any regressions? [list]

## üìù TEAM WHITMAN - The Documentarian

**Specialization:** Documentation Cleanup  
**Mission:** Update FALSE_LEADS_SUMMARY.md and related docs

### üì¶ Unit of Work: Documentation Cleanup

**Objective:** Correct misleading documentation based on new findings

**Tasks:**

1. **Wait for All Other Teams**
   - [ ] TEAM MONET: Code audit complete
   - [ ] TEAM PICASSO: cuBLAS resolved
   - [ ] TEAM VAN GOGH: Weights resolved
   - [ ] TEAM SHAKESPEARE: Integration tested
   - [ ] TEAM FROST: Sampling verified
   - [ ] TEAM DICKINSON: Parity checked
   - [ ] TEAM REMBRANDT: Fixes restored

2. **Update FALSE_LEADS_SUMMARY.md**
   
   **Mark as REAL BUGS (not false leads):**
   - [ ] False Lead #8: CUBLAS_OP_T (if PICASSO confirms)
   - [ ] False Lead #9: Output RMSNorm (if VAN GOGH confirms corruption)
   - [ ] False Lead #12: Softmax (CASCADE already proved this)
   
   **Add new section:**
   ```markdown
   ## ‚ö†Ô∏è POST-FIX UPDATE (2025-10-07)
   
   After fixing multiple bugs (softmax underflow, sampling order, cuBLAS, 
   weights, config), several "false leads" were re-validated and found to 
   be REAL BUGS that were masked by other bugs.
   
   ### False Leads That Were Actually Real Bugs:
   - #8: CUBLAS_OP_T [CONFIRMED BY TEAM PICASSO]
   - #9: Output norm weights [CONFIRMED BY TEAM VAN GOGH]
   - #12: Softmax underflow [CONFIRMED BY TEAM CASCADE]
   
   ### Lesson Learned:
   "Still broken after fix" ‚â† "Not a bug"
   Multiple bugs can exist simultaneously. Fixing one doesn't guarantee output is correct.
   ```

3. **Update Team Reports with Warnings**
   
   **Add to TEAM_FELICIA_FINAL.md:**
   ```markdown
   ## ‚ö†Ô∏è POST-FIX UPDATE (2025-10-07)
   
   TEAM PICASSO re-validated this approach and found that CUBLAS_OP_T 
   IS correct. The "stuck repetition" we observed was caused by OTHER bugs 
   (softmax underflow, sampling order) that have since been fixed.
   
   Our fix was CORRECT but INSUFFICIENT alone.
   ```
   
   **Add to TEAM_AURORA_HANDOFF.md:**
   ```markdown
   ## ‚ö†Ô∏è POST-FIX UPDATE (2025-10-07)
   
   TEAM PICASSO confirmed that CUBLAS_OP_T with our lda values IS correct.
   The test failures we observed were due to downstream bugs that have 
   since been fixed.
   ```
   
   **Add to TEAM_SENTINEL_VICTORY.md:**
   ```markdown
   ## ‚úÖ POST-FIX VALIDATION (2025-10-07)
   
   TEAM PICASSO confirmed our fix is correct. The "still garbage" output 
   was caused by OTHER bugs (softmax underflow, sampling order) that have 
   since been fixed by TEAM CASCADE and TEAM HELIOS.
   
   Our fix WAS necessary. It just wasn't sufficient alone.
   ```

4. **Create Summary Document**
   
   **File:** `investigation-teams/POST_FIX_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`
   
   **Contents:**
   - Summary of all team findings
   - Which fixes are applied
   - Which contradictions were resolved
   - Current status of the codebase
   - Lessons learned

5. **Update winners.md**
   
   **Add note about cascade effect:**
   ```markdown
   ## üîÑ Important Note About Bug Fixes
   
   These bugs formed a CONSTELLATION - all needed fixing for the model to work.
   
   Several teams (FELICIA, AURORA) found correct fixes but reverted them 
   because output was still broken due to OTHER bugs. This led to confusion 
   about which fixes were correct.
   
   After ALL bugs were fixed, we re-validated previous investigations and 
   found that many "false leads" were actually REAL bugs.
   ```
