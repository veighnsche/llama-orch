# 🎨 TEAM REMBRANDT - Fix Restoration Chronicle

**Round:** 2  
**Specialization:** Reverted Fix Re-Application  
**Mission:** Re-apply fixes that were incorrectly reverted  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR TEAM PICASSO & TEAM VAN GOGH

---

## 👥 Team Introduction

**Team Name:** REMBRANDT (after Rembrandt van Rijn, master of restoration and light)

**Why This Name:**
Rembrandt's paintings have been restored many times, bringing back their original brilliance. TEAM REMBRANDT restores code fixes that were lost, bringing back their original correctness.

**Team Philosophy:**
*"Sometimes the right answer was there all along—it just got painted over."*

**Specialization:**
We are the fix restorers. Round 1 had teams that found CORRECT fixes but reverted them because output was still broken due to OTHER bugs. Now that those other bugs are fixed, we restore the correct fixes that were lost.

We don't investigate new bugs. We restore old solutions.

---

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Identify and re-apply any fixes that were reverted but are actually correct

**Why This Matters:**
Multiple teams in Round 1 found correct fixes but concluded they were wrong because output was still broken:
- FELICIA: Reverted CUBLAS_OP_T
- AURORA: Reverted CUBLAS_OP_T with correct lda
- Possibly others

Now that we know the bug was a CONSTELLATION (multiple bugs needed fixing), we need to restore these correct fixes.

**Dependencies:**
- TEAM PICASSO (verdict on cuBLAS)
- TEAM VAN GOGH (verdict on weights)

**Teams Depending On Us:**
- TEAM SHAKESPEARE (needs all fixes applied for integration test)

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. cuBLAS Fix Restoration (if needed)

**TEAM PICASSO's verdict:** CUBLAS_OP_T / CUBLAS_OP_N

**Current code state:** CUBLAS_OP_T / CUBLAS_OP_N

**Action needed:**
- ✅ No action (already correct)
- ⚠️ Need to apply CUBLAS_OP_T
- ⚠️ Need to apply CUBLAS_OP_N

**If restoration needed:**

**Changes made:**
```
File: cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp
- Line 327 (Q proj): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
- Line 361 (K proj): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
- Line 386 (V proj): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
- Line 574 (Attn out): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
- Line 926 (lm_head): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???

File: cuda/kernels/swiglu_ffn.cu
- Line 132 (FFN gate): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
- Line 151 (FFN up): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
- Line 181 (FFN down): Changed to CUBLAS_OP_? with lda=???
```

**Test after changes:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  --features cuda --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Result:**
- Test: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Output: [first 100 chars]
- Quality: ✅ Coherent / ❌ Garbage / ⚠️ Repetitive

### 2. Weight Fix Restoration (if needed)

**TEAM VAN GOGH's verdict:** Normalized / Raw

**Current code state:** Normalized / Raw

**Action needed:**
- ✅ No action (already correct)
- ⚠️ Need to normalize weights
- ⚠️ Need to use raw weights

**If restoration needed:**

**Changes made:**
```
File: cuda/src/model/qwen_weight_loader.cpp
- Line ???: [describe change]
```

**Test after changes:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  --features cuda --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Result:**
- Test: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Output: [first 100 chars]
- Quality: ✅ Coherent / ❌ Garbage / ⚠️ Repetitive

### 3. Other Reverted Fixes Search

**Git history search:**
```bash
cd bin/worker-orcd
git log --all --grep="revert" --oneline
git log --all --grep="undo" --oneline
git log --all --grep="rollback" --oneline
```

**Reverted commits found:**

| Commit | Date | Author | Reason for Revert | Should Restore? |
|--------|------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [hash] | [date] | [name] | [reason] | ✅ / ❌ |
| [hash] | [date] | [name] | [reason] | ✅ / ❌ |

```

**Restoration process:**
```bash
# For each commit to restore:
git cherry-pick [hash]
# Or manually re-apply changes
```

### 4. Full Test Suite Verification

**After all restorations:**
```bash
cargo test --features cuda --release
```

**Results:**
