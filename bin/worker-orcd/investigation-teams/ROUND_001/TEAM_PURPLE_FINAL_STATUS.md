# Team PURPLE - Final Investigation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-06 21:25 UTC  
**Mission:** Hunt down garbage output bug  
**Status:** ⚠️ **TOKENIZATION VERIFIED - BUG IS ELSEWHERE**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Team Purple verified that **tokenization and prompt formatting are CORRECT**. The bug is NOT in the tokenization layer. Team Blue's fix (using special token IDs 151644/151645) was correct. The garbage output must be caused by something deeper in the inference pipeline.

---

## ✅ What Team Purple Verified

### 1. Special Token IDs Are Correct
From llama.cpp debug log:
- Token 151643 = BOS/PAD (endoftext)
- Token 151644 = `<|im_start|>` ✅
- Token 151645 = `<|im_end|>` ✅

Team Blue's hardcoded IDs were correct!

### 2. Special Token Embeddings Are Valid
```
Token 151643 embedding: 0.0031 0.0067 0.0078 ... ✅ Has values
Token 151644 embedding: 0.0014 -0.0084 0.0073 ... ✅ Has values  
Token 151645 embedding: 0.0029 -0.0117 0.0049 ... ✅ Has values
```

NOT zeros, NOT garbage. Normal FP16 values (~0.01 range).

### 3. Token Sequence Matches llama.cpp Format
```
[0] 151644 → <|im_start|>
[1] 872 → user
[2] 198 → \n
[3-27] ... prompt text ...
[28] 151645 → <|im_end|>
[29] 198 → \n
[30] 151644 → <|im_start|>
[31] 77091 → assistant
```

This matches the llama.cpp chat template exactly:
```
<|im_start|>user
{content}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

### 4. Embedding Lookup Works Correctly
```
[GREEN] Embedding output[0..9]: 0.0014 -0.0084 0.0073 -0.0016 -0.0079 0.0049 -0.0077 0.0126 -0.0031 -0.0119
```

This matches token 151644's embedding exactly! The CUDA embedding lookup kernel is working.

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Removed newline after "assistant"
**Before:**
```rust
let assistant_tokens = self.tokenizer.encode("assistant\n", false)?;
```

**After:**
```rust
let assistant_tokens = self.tokenizer.encode("assistant", false)?;
```

**Rationale:** llama.cpp chat template shows `<|im_start|>assistant` with NO newline after "assistant". The newline comes as part of the generation.

**Result:** Token sequence now matches llama.cpp, but **output is still garbage**.

---

## ❌ What's Still Broken

**Symptom:** Model generates garbage tokens:
```
[0] ID=131916 → "ãĤ¸ãĥ¥"
[1] ID=72696 → "Ġsupplementation"
[2] ID=13267 → "serve"
[3] ID=105030 → "åŁĭ"
...
```

**Characteristics:**
- Code-related tokens (toHaveBeenCalledWith, psycopg, etc.)
- Foreign language tokens (Chinese, Thai, Korean)
- NO haiku-related words
- Model doesn't understand context AT ALL

---

## 🔍 Where The Bug Must Be

Since tokenization is correct, the bug must be in:

### 1. **Forward Pass**
- Attention mechanism
- FFN (SwiGLU)
- Residual connections
- Layer normalization

### 2. **KV Cache**
- Cache population during prefill
- Cache retrieval during generation
- Position tracking

### 3. **Position Encoding**
- RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
- Position indices for each token

### 4. **Sampling**
- Logits computation
- Temperature/top-k/top-p
- Argmax selection

### 5. **Stop Token Handling**
- Are we stopping at the right tokens?
- Are we continuing past stop tokens?

---

## 🧪 Evidence

### The Model Doesn't Understand Context
If tokenization were wrong, we'd expect:
- Slightly off responses
- Some correct words mixed with garbage
- Model trying but failing

Instead we see:
- **Completely random tokens**
- **No semantic connection to prompt**
- **Code/foreign language tokens** (wrong domain entirely)

This suggests the model is seeing **corrupted hidden states** or **wrong attention patterns**, NOT wrong tokens.

---

## 💡 Debugging Recommendations

### 1. Compare Hidden States with llama.cpp
Add logging to dump hidden states after each layer and compare with llama.cpp for the SAME prompt.

### 2. Check Attention Weights
Verify that attention is focusing on the right tokens (user prompt, not random positions).

### 3. Verify KV Cache
Check that KV cache contains the correct values from the prefill phase.

### 4. Test Without KV Cache
Try disabling KV cache to see if the bug is in cache handling.

### 5. Check Position Indices
Verify that position indices are correct for each token during prefill and generation.

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`bin/worker-orcd/src/inference/cuda_backend.rs`**
   - Removed newline after "assistant" (line 220)
   - Added extensive debug logging for tokenization

2. **`bin/worker-orcd/cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`**
   - Added logging to check special token embeddings (lines 1055-1082)
   - Added logging to verify token IDs being embedded (lines 1033-1049)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Next Team

1. **Focus on forward pass, NOT tokenization**
2. **Compare hidden states with llama.cpp** at each layer
3. **Check attention patterns** - are they focusing on the right tokens?
4. **Verify KV cache** - does it contain correct values?
5. **Test position encoding** - are positions calculated correctly?

**Team PURPLE 🟣**  
*"Tokenization is correct. The bug is deeper."*

**Time Spent:** ~15 minutes  
**Bugs Fixed:** 0 (but ruled out tokenization as the cause)  
**Key Finding:** Special tokens and prompt format are correct - bug is in inference pipeline
