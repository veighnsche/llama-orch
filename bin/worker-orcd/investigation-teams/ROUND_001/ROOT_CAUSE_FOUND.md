# üî• PARTIAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Date**: 2025-10-06 16:15 UTC (Updated: 16:32 UTC)  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL FIX - STILL BROKEN**

---

## Executive Summary

**The bug is in the `output_norm.weight` tensor - it contains CORRUPTED DATA!**

- **Expected**: RMSNorm weights ~1.0 (range [0.5, 1.5])
- **Actual**: Range [-0.0114, **16.7500**], Mean=7.14 ‚ùå

This causes the final RMSNorm to **amplify** values instead of normalizing them:
- Before norm: ¬±20.9 (manageable)
- After norm: ¬±32.8 (amplified by 16.75x!)

This leads to abnormally high logits (14+) which cause repetitive token generation.

## UPDATE (2025-10-06 16:32 UTC): Fix Attempted

**FIX APPLIED**: Normalized output_norm.weight to mean=1.0 (scaled by 0.1401)

**RESULTS**:
- ‚úÖ Hidden state after norm: **¬±4.6** (was ¬±32.8) - FIXED!
- ‚úÖ Max logit: **2.17** (was 14+) - MUCH BETTER!
- ‚ùå Still generates same token repeatedly - NOT FULLY FIXED!

**CONCLUSION**: The corrupted weights made the problem WORSE, but there's a **deeper issue**.

Even with reasonable logits (2.17), token 44394 still dominates because:
1. Other logits are even lower (first 10: [-0.66, 0.62])
2. Token 44394 has 2.17 ‚Üí 3x higher than average
3. Softmax still heavily weights it

**The bug is NOT just corrupted weights - there's something else wrong!**

## Evidence

### Test Output
```
[DEEP_INVESTIGATION] Final RMSNorm Analysis:
  BEFORE norm: Range=[-20.9688, 23.4062], Mean=-0.1518, RMS=6.7737
  Norm WEIGHTS: Range=[-0.0114, 16.7500], Mean=7.1393  ‚Üê WRONG!
  AFTER norm: Range=[-32.8125, 31.2188], Mean=-0.1597, Std=7.3213
  Manual check [0]: expected=-11.0354, actual=-11.0391, diff=0.0037
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: output_norm weights are abnormal!
```

### What Should Happen

RMSNorm formula: `output = (input / rms) * weight`

With **normal** weights (~1.0):
- Input: ¬±20.9, RMS=6.77
- Normalized: ¬±3.09 (20.9 / 6.77)
- After weight: ¬±3.09 (3.09 * 1.0) ‚úÖ

With **corrupted** weights (up to 16.75):
- Input: ¬±20.9, RMS=6.77
- Normalized: ¬±3.09
- After weight: ¬±51.8 (3.09 * 16.75) ‚ùå

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Chain of Causation

1. **`output_norm.weight` is corrupted** (contains values up to 16.75)
2. **Final RMSNorm amplifies instead of normalizing** (multiplies by 16.75x)
3. **Hidden state grows to ¬±32.8** (should be ¬±3-5)
4. **Dot product with lm_head produces huge values** (14+)
5. **Softmax heavily weights the highest logit** (probability ~99.9%)
6. **Model always selects the same token** (repetitive generation)

### Why Hidden State Grows Across Layers

The investigation also revealed that hidden state grows exponentially:
- Embedding: ¬±0.04
- Layer 10: ¬±6.8
- Layer 20: ¬±18
- Layer 23: ¬±23.4
- **After final norm: ¬±32.8** (amplified by corrupted weights!)

This is due to:
1. **Residual accumulation** across 24 layers (normal behavior)
2. **Corrupted final normalization** that amplifies instead of constraining

## Possible Causes of Corruption

### 1. Weight Loading Bug (Most Likely)

The tensor might be:
- **Loaded from wrong offset** in GGUF file
- **Misinterpreted type** (e.g., reading quantized as FP16)
- **Wrong tensor name** (loading a different tensor)
- **Byte order issue** (endianness problem)

**Action**: Check `output_norm.weight` loading in `weight_loader.rs`

### 2. GGUF File Corruption

The model file itself might be corrupted.

**Action**: Re-download model or try different model file

### 3. Dequantization Bug

If `output_norm.weight` is quantized, the dequantization might be wrong.

**Action**: Check if this tensor is quantized and verify dequant logic

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Tensor in GGUF File

```bash
# Use gguf-dump or similar tool to inspect output_norm.weight
python3 -c "
from gguf import GGUFReader
reader = GGUFReader('model.gguf')
for tensor in reader.tensors:
    if 'output_norm' in tensor.name:
        print(f'{tensor.name}: shape={tensor.shape}, type={tensor.tensor_type}')
        # Print first few values
"
```

### 2. Compare with llama.cpp

```bash
# Run llama.cpp and extract output_norm values
# Compare with our values to see if loading is correct
```

### 3. Check Weight Loader Code

File: `src/cuda/weight_loader.rs`
- Line 324 in `qwen_weight_loader.cpp`: `get_ptr("output_norm.weight")`
- Verify this tensor name matches GGUF file
- Check if dequantization is applied correctly

---

## Recommended Fix

### Option 1: Fix Weight Loading (Proper Solution)

1. **Identify the bug** in weight loading
2. **Fix the loading code** to get correct values
3. **Verify** weights are in range [0.5, 1.5]
4. **Test** that generation works

### Option 2: Clamp Weights (Temporary Workaround)

```cpp
// In qwen_transformer.cpp, after loading model:
void clamp_output_norm_weights() {
    half h_weights[896];
    cudaMemcpy(h_weights, model_->weights.output_norm, 896*sizeof(half), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 896; i++) {
        float w = __half2float(h_weights[i]);
        if (w > 2.0f) w = 1.0f;  // Clamp abnormal values
        if (w < 0.1f) w = 1.0f;
        h_weights[i] = __float2half(w);
    }
    
    cudaMemcpy(model_->weights.output_norm, h_weights, 896*sizeof(half), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
}
```

### Option 3: Skip Final Norm (Diagnostic)

```cpp
// Test if skipping final norm fixes generation:
// Instead of:
cuda_rmsnorm_forward(layer_input, model_->weights.output_norm, normed_, ...);

// Try:
cudaMemcpy(normed_, layer_input, config_.hidden_dim * sizeof(half), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);
```

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Check `output_norm.weight` loading in weight_loader.rs
2. Verify tensor name matches GGUF file exactly
3. Check if tensor is quantized and needs dequantization
4. Compare first 10 values with llama.cpp
5. If loading is correct, check if GGUF file is corrupted

## Conclusion

**UPDATE (2025-10-06 16:32 UTC)**: My hypothesis was **PARTIALLY CORRECT**.

The corrupted `output_norm.weight` values (up to 16.75) made the problem worse:
- With corrupted weights: logits = 14+, hidden state = ¬±32.8
- With fixed weights: logits = 2+, hidden state = ¬±4.6

**BUT** the model still generates repetitive tokens even with the fix!

This means:
1. ‚úÖ Corrupted weights were **part** of the problem
2. ‚ùå There's a **deeper issue** causing certain tokens to dominate
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è The root cause is **NOT fully identified yet**

**Possible remaining causes**:
1. Hidden state is still abnormal (¬±23.4 before final norm)
2. Layer normalization weights in earlier layers might also be wrong
3. Model file itself might be fundamentally corrupted
4. There's a bias or scaling issue elsewhere

**Next investigator**: Check if OTHER norm weights (attn_norm, ffn_norm) are also corrupted!
