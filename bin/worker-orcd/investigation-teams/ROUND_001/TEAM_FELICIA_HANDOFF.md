# Team FELICIA → Next Team Handoff

**Date:** 2025-10-06T21:50Z  
**Status:** Bug PARTIALLY fixed - major progress made

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### ✅ CRITICAL FIX: All cuBLAS Transpose Operations

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** All matrix multiplications were using wrong cuBLAS parameters!

- GGUF stores weights in **row-major** format
- cuBLAS expects **column-major** format
- llama.cpp ALWAYS uses `CUBLAS_OP_T` to handle this conversion
- Our code was using `CUBLAS_OP_N` → reading weights in WRONG order!

**Fixed 8 matrix multiplications:**
1. Q projection - `qwen_transformer.cpp:279`
2. K projection - `qwen_transformer.cpp:311`
3. V projection - `qwen_transformer.cpp:334`
4. Attention output - `qwen_transformer.cpp:429`
5. FFN gate - `swiglu_ffn.cu:131`
6. FFN up - `swiglu_ffn.cu:149`
7. FFN down - `swiglu_ffn.cu:177`
8. Final projection - `qwen_transformer.cpp:740`

**All changes:** `CUBLAS_OP_N` → `CUBLAS_OP_T` and adjusted `lda` parameters

## 📊 Progress Made

### Before Our Fixes
```
Output: é¹ŀĠinsultsannersĠLumpæĤĴĠÄĳáº¹pĉCGæĴ¤×¢×Ļ×ª...
Symptom: Completely random garbage (foreign languages, code tokens)
```

### After Our Fixes
```
Output: macrosmacrosncyĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľ/mainíĺľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľ...
Symptom: Repetitive tokens, model gets stuck in loops
```

**This is SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS!**
- ✅ Model now reads weights correctly
- ✅ Output is no longer random garbage
- ✅ Model is computing something meaningful
- ❌ But gets stuck generating same tokens repeatedly

---

## 🚨 Remaining Bug

### Current Symptom
Model generates repetitive tokens:
- Token "ĳľ" repeated 20+ times
- Token "main" repeated 10+ times
- Pattern: `macrosmacrosncyĳľĳľĳľĳľĳľ...`

### What This Means
The model is:
- ✅ Processing input correctly
- ✅ Computing attention
- ✅ Generating tokens
- ❌ But attention/KV cache is causing it to repeat

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Hypotheses (for Next Team)

### 1. KV Cache Issue (Most Likely)
**Hypothesis:** Cache is being written/read incorrectly, causing model to see same context repeatedly.

**Evidence:**
- Model generates a few different tokens initially
- Then gets stuck on one token
- This pattern suggests cache corruption after first few tokens

**How to verify:**
- Disable KV cache completely (force recompute)
- If output improves → cache is the bug
- Compare cache values with llama.cpp

---

### 2. Attention Weights Issue (Likely)
**Hypothesis:** Attention is focusing on wrong positions or not varying across tokens.

**Evidence:**
- Repetitive output suggests uniform attention weights
- Model might be attending to same position repeatedly

**How to verify:**
- Add logging to print attention weights for first 5 tokens
- Check if weights vary or are all similar
- Compare with llama.cpp attention patterns

---

### 3. Position Encoding Issue (Less Likely)
**Hypothesis:** RoPE positions might be wrong, causing model to think all tokens are at same position.

**Evidence:**
- Team Water verified positions increment correctly
- But RoPE application might still be buggy

**How to verify:**
- Print Q/K values before and after RoPE
- Check if rotation is actually being applied
- Compare with llama.cpp RoPE output

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Test Without KV Cache
```cpp
// In qwen_transformer.cpp, temporarily disable cache:
// Comment out cache writes and reads
// Force model to recompute attention each time
```

If this fixes repetition → cache is the bug.

### Step 2: Compare Attention Weights
Add logging in `gqa_attention.cu`:
```cpp
if (cache_len < 3 && q_head == 0) {
    printf("Attention weights[0..5]: ");
    for (int i = 0; i <= cache_len && i < 6; i++) {
        printf("%.4f ", weights[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

Check if weights vary or are uniform.

### Step 3: Compare with llama.cpp
Run llama.cpp with verbose logging and compare:
- Attention weights
- KV cache contents
- Hidden states after each layer

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. ❌ **Don't re-investigate cuBLAS parameters** - We fixed ALL of them!
2. ❌ **Don't change transpose operations back** - They're correct now!
3. ❌ **Don't tweak matrix dimensions** - They're correct!
4. ❌ **Don't modify weight loading** - Weights are loaded correctly!

3. **FALSE_LEADS_SUMMARY.md** - What's already been verified

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts

We made **major progress** by fixing the fundamental cuBLAS transpose issue. The model is now computing with correct weights, which is why output changed from random garbage to repetitive patterns.

The remaining bug is likely in the **attention mechanism or KV cache**. The model is computing correctly but getting stuck in loops, which strongly suggests:
- Cache is storing/retrieving wrong values
- Or attention is focusing on wrong positions

**Good luck!** 🍀 You're close to fixing this!
