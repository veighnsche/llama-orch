## Comment Style Guide

All comments follow this pattern:

```cpp
// ============================================================================
// [TEAM_NAME] SECTION TITLE
// ============================================================================
// Status indicators: ✅ ❌ ⚠️ 🔥 📊 📝 🔗
//
// Key information...
//
// Reference: investigation-teams/DOCUMENT.md
// ============================================================================
```

### Status Indicators Used

- ✅ **Verified Correct**: Component works as expected
- ❌ **Wrong/Incorrect**: Known incorrect implementation
- ⚠️ **Warning/Caution**: Potential issue, needs investigation
- 🔥 **Critical/Bug Found**: Important finding
- 📊 **Analysis/Data**: Detailed analysis or measurements
- 📝 **Documentation**: Explanatory notes
- 🔗 **Reference**: Link to related documents

## Key Themes Across All Comments

### 1. Model File is Correct
Every comment emphasizes that llama.cpp generates perfect output with the same model file, proving the GGUF file is not corrupted.

### 2. Charlie Was Wrong About Weights
Multiple comments clarify that weights with unusual values (mean=7.14) are CORRECT, not corrupted.

### 3. llama.cpp as Ground Truth
All comments provide the verification command to run llama.cpp and compare results.

### 4. Potential Bug Locations
Comments clearly mark which components are verified correct vs. which need investigation:
- ✅ Verified: Embeddings, RMSNorm, cuBLAS, Residual, Softmax
- ⚠️ Investigate: RoPE, Attention, KV cache, FFN

### 5. Reference Documents
All comments point to investigation documents:
- `TEAM_CHARLIE_I_WAS_WRONG.md`
- `TEAM_CHARLIE_BETA_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `TEAM_CHARLIE_BETA_BUG_FIXED.md`

## Impact

### For Future Investigators

These comments will:
1. **Save time**: No need to re-verify already-correct components
2. **Prevent mistakes**: Clear warnings about Charlie's wrong conclusions
3. **Focus effort**: Direct attention to unverified components
4. **Provide context**: Explain what has been tried and why

### For Code Maintenance

These comments:
1. **Document assumptions**: Explain why code is written a certain way
2. **Preserve history**: Record investigation findings
3. **Aid debugging**: Provide starting points for future debugging
4. **Improve onboarding**: Help new developers understand the codebase
