# Team Water - Investigation Findings

**Date**: 2025-10-06 17:38-17:45 UTC  
**Status**: 🔍 **CACHE INFRASTRUCTURE VERIFIED - BUG IS ELSEWHERE**

---

## Summary

Team Charlie Gamma's clue about `cache_len=0` was **INCORRECT**. I verified that:
- ✅ `cache_len` parameter is passed correctly (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Cache writes happen at correct positions
- ✅ Cache reads use correct indexing
- ✅ Position tracking works correctly
- ✅ Both wrapper and kernel receive correct values
- ❌ Model still generates repetitive garbage

**The bug is NOT in parameter passing or cache infrastructure.**

**All investigation steps documented with [TEAM_WATER] comments in code.**

---

## What I Verified

### 1. Parameter Passing ✅

Added debug output to wrapper function. Results:

```
Token 0, Layer 0-23: cache_len=0 ✅
Token 1, Layer 0-23: cache_len=1 ✅  
Token 2, Layer 0-23: cache_len=2 ✅
Token 3, Layer 0-23: cache_len=3 ✅
```

**Wrapper receives correct values from transformer.**

### 2. Kernel Reception ✅

Kernel debug shows:

```
[ATTENTION DEBUG] cache_len=0 (24 times for token 0) ✅
[ATTENTION DEBUG] cache_len=1 (24 times for token 1) ✅
[ATTENTION DEBUG] cache_len=2 (24 times for token 2) ✅
```

**Kernel receives correct values from wrapper.**

### 3. Cache Writes ✅

Added cache write debug. Results:

```
[CACHE WRITE] cache_len=0, writing to cache pos 0 ✅
[CACHE WRITE] cache_len=1, writing to cache pos 1 ✅
[CACHE WRITE] cache_len=2, writing to cache pos 2 ✅
```

**Cache is being written at correct positions.**

## What's Still Broken

### Output Quality ❌

```
ĠseparatelyĠwavelengthsĠseparatelyĠwavelengthsĠseparately...
```

Model generates repetitive patterns and garbage tokens.

---

## Where The Bug Actually Is

Since cache infrastructure is correct, the bug must be in:

1. **Model weights** - Wrong values loaded?
2. **Computation logic** - FFN, attention math, etc.?
3. **Data corruption** - Values getting corrupted somewhere?
4. **Numerical instability** - Values exploding/vanishing?

---

## Key Clues

### Pattern Analysis

- First few tokens vary
- Then model gets stuck in loops
- Suggests model CAN generate different tokens initially
- Something breaks after a few iterations

### What Works

- ✅ Cache read/write positions
- ✅ Parameter passing
- ✅ Softmax (weights sum to 1.0)
- ✅ RMSNorm
- ✅ cuBLAS operations

### What's Suspicious

- ❌ Output quality degrades quickly
- ❌ Repetitive patterns emerge
- ❌ Model doesn't follow prompt

---

## Recommendations for Next Team

### Focus Areas

1. **Check model weights** - Are FFN/attention weights correct?
2. **Check intermediate values** - Are hidden states reasonable?
3. **Compare with llama.cpp** - Run same model there, compare outputs
4. **Check for NaN/Inf** - Add checks for invalid values

### Don't Waste Time On

- ❌ Cache infrastructure (verified working)
- ❌ Parameter passing (verified working)  
- ❌ Softmax (verified working)

### Files Modified with [TEAM_WATER] Comments

1. **`cuda/kernels/gqa_attention.cu`**
   - Line 107-112: Verified kernel receives correct cache_len
   - Line 154-160: Verified cache read indexing is correct
   - Line 372-377: Verified cache writes happen at correct positions
   - Line 623-637: Verified wrapper receives correct parameters

2. **`cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`**
   - Line 307-314: Verified cache_len parameter passing is correct
   - Line 840-845: Verified pos increments correctly
   - Line 1078-1084: Verified position increment logic is correct

3. **`cuda/kernels/rope.cu`**
   - Line 154-159: Confirmed RoPE is working correctly

4. **`cuda/src/model/qwen_weight_loader.cpp`**
   - Line 362: Noted ffn_down fix was good but not THE bug

5. **`tests/haiku_generation_anti_cheat.rs`**
   - Line 152-160: Added investigation status summary

### To Remove Debug Output

Search for `[TEAM_WATER]` comments. Debug printf statements can be removed:
- `[WRAPPER DEBUG]` in gqa_attention.cu
- `[CACHE WRITE]` in gqa_attention.cu

## Test Command

```bash
cargo test --release --features cuda --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  test_haiku_generation_stub_pipeline_only -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## Summary of What I Checked

### ✅ Verified Working (NOT the bug)

1. **Parameter Passing** - cache_len flows correctly from transformer → wrapper → kernel
2. **Cache Writes** - K/V written to correct positions (0, 1, 2, 3...)
3. **Cache Reads** - Loop correctly reads from pos 0 to cache_len
4. **Position Tracking** - pos increments correctly (0→1→2→3...)
5. **RoPE** - Applies different rotations per position

### ❌ Still Broken

- Model generates repetitive garbage output
- Pattern: "ĠseparatelyĠwavelengthsĠseparatelyĠwavelengths..."
- Suggests model gets stuck in loops

### 🔍 Where Bug Actually Is

Since cache infrastructure is correct, bug must be in:
- Model computation logic (FFN, attention math)
- Weight values or loading
- Numerical issues (NaN, Inf, overflow)
- Something else entirely
