## Code Files Modified

All investigation code has been **commented out** or marked with `[TEAM_CHARLIE]` tags.

### 1. `cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`

**Lines 7-41**: Investigation summary at top of file
- Quick overview of what was tested
- Root cause identified
- Pointers to next steps

**Lines 486-550**: TEST 1 - Manual dot product verification
- Verified cuBLAS is computing correctly
- All 9 test positions match within FP16 tolerance
- **Conclusion**: Bug is NOT in cuBLAS or matrix multiplication

**Lines 689-786**: TEST 2 - Hidden state evolution tracking
- Tracked values across all 24 transformer layers
- Values grow from ¬±0.04 to ¬±23.4 (normal residual accumulation)
- **Conclusion**: Growth is normal, should be constrained by norms

**Lines 798-873**: TEST 3 - Final RMSNorm analysis
- Analyzed input, weights, and output of final RMSNorm
- **Found corrupted weights**: Range [-0.0114, 16.7500], Mean=7.14
- **Conclusion**: This is the bug! Weights amplify by 16x instead of normalizing

### 2. `cuda/kernels/rmsnorm.cu`

**Lines 8-24**: Investigation note
- Verified RMSNorm kernel implementation is correct
- Manually computed expected output, matches actual
- **Conclusion**: Kernel is fine, weights are corrupted

### 3. `cuda/kernels/residual.cu`

**Lines 8-25**: Investigation note
- Investigated residual accumulation as potential cause
- Found 508x growth across layers (normal behavior)
- **Conclusion**: Residual addition is working correctly

## What Was Ruled Out

### ‚úÖ NOT the bug:
- cuBLAS matrix multiplication (verified correct)
- Memory access patterns (column-wise access confirmed)
- RMSNorm kernel implementation (verified correct)
- Residual connection accumulation (normal behavior)
- Attention mechanism (softmax verified correct)

### ‚ùå IS the bug:
- **`output_norm.weight` tensor is corrupted**
- Contains values up to 16.75 (should be ~1.0)
- Causes final RMSNorm to amplify instead of normalize
- Results in hidden state ¬±32.8 ‚Üí logits 14+ ‚Üí repetitive tokens

---

## Next Steps for Future Investigators

### DO NOT investigate these (already verified correct):
- ‚ùå cuBLAS parameters in `project_to_vocab`
- ‚ùå RMSNorm kernel implementation
- ‚ùå Residual connection logic
- ‚ùå Attention mechanism

### DO investigate these:
1. ‚úÖ **`src/cuda/weight_loader.rs`** - How is `output_norm.weight` loaded?
2. ‚úÖ Check tensor name: Is it `"output_norm.weight"` in GGUF?
3. ‚úÖ Check dequantization: Is this tensor quantized? Is dequant correct?
4. ‚úÖ Compare with llama.cpp: What values does it load for this tensor?
5. ‚úÖ Try different model file: Is the GGUF file corrupted?

## Test Commands

### To see the investigation output:

```bash
cd /home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/worker-orcd

# Run test and see Team Charlie's output
cargo test --release --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  test_haiku_generation_stub_pipeline_only \
  --features cuda -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1 \
  2>&1 | grep -A 20 "TEAM_CHARLIE\|DEEP_INVESTIGATION"
```

### To see the corrupted weights:

```bash
# Look for this in output:
# [DEEP_INVESTIGATION] Final RMSNorm Analysis:
#   Norm WEIGHTS: Range=[-0.0114, 16.7500], Mean=7.1393  ‚Üê ABNORMAL!
```

## Key Findings Summary

### The Bug

**`output_norm.weight` tensor is corrupted**

Expected values:
```
Range: [0.5, 1.5]
Mean: ~1.0
Purpose: Scale normalized values (should be close to 1.0)
```

Actual values:
```
Range: [-0.0114, 16.7500]  ‚ùå
Mean: 7.1393               ‚ùå
Effect: Amplifies by 16x instead of normalizing
```

### The Impact

```
Before final norm: ¬±23.4 (manageable)
After final norm:  ¬±32.8 (amplified!)
Logits:            14+ (abnormally high)
Softmax:           ~99.9% on one token
Result:            Repetitive generation
```
