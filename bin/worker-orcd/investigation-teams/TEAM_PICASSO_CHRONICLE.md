# 🎨 TEAM PICASSO - cuBLAS Resolution Chronicle

**Round:** 2  
**Specialization:** Contradiction Resolution  
**Mission:** Resolve the CUBLAS_OP_T vs CUBLAS_OP_N contradiction  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR TEAM MONET

---

## 👥 Team Introduction

**Team Name:** PICASSO (after Pablo Picasso, master of seeing truth from multiple perspectives)

**Why This Name:**
Picasso revolutionized art by showing the same subject from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. TEAM PICASSO resolves contradictions by examining all perspectives and finding the truth.

**Team Philosophy:**
*"When experts disagree, we test everything."*

**Specialization:**
We are the contradiction resolvers. Round 1 left us with conflicting claims:
- FELICIA: "CUBLAS_OP_T is WRONG"
- AURORA: "CUBLAS_OP_T is WRONG"
- SENTINEL: "CUBLAS_OP_T is CORRECT"
- ALPHA: "CUBLAS_OP_N is CORRECT"

Who was right? We'll find out by testing BOTH approaches and comparing against llama.cpp ground truth.

---

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Determine definitively whether CUBLAS_OP_T or CUBLAS_OP_N is correct

**Why This Matters:**
This is the most critical contradiction from Round 1. Multiple teams spent hours on this and reached opposite conclusions. We need to settle this once and for all.

**Dependencies:**
- TEAM MONET (need to know current state)

**Teams Depending On Us:**
- TEAM REMBRANDT (needs our verdict to know what to restore)

[Your observations]
```

### 3. SENTINEL's Verification Reproduction

**Test:** [Describe test method]

**Results:**
- Manual Q[0]: ???
- cuBLAS Q[0]: ???
- Diff: ???
- Status: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

**Notes:**
```
[Your observations]
```

### 4. llama.cpp Ground Truth

**Command:**
```bash
cd reference/llama.cpp
./llama-cli -m ../../models/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct.gguf \
  -p "Write a haiku about GPU computing" \
  --log-disable 0 > llama_output.log 2>&1
```

**Q[0] value from llama.cpp:** ???

**Comparison:**
- Matches ALPHA's value? ✅ / ❌
- Matches SENTINEL's value? ✅ / ❌

### 5. End-to-End Test: CUBLAS_OP_N

**Changes made:**
```
[List code changes to test CUBLAS_OP_N]
```

**Test command:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  --features cuda --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Results:**
- Output: [first 100 chars]
- Quality: ✅ Coherent / ❌ Garbage / ⚠️ Repetitive
- Test: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### 6. End-to-End Test: CUBLAS_OP_T

**Changes made:**
```
[List code changes to test CUBLAS_OP_T]
```

**Test command:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  --features cuda --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Results:**
- Output: [first 100 chars]
- Quality: ✅ Coherent / ❌ Garbage / ⚠️ Repetitive
- Test: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### 7. Root Cause Analysis: Why FELICIA/AURORA Failed

**FELICIA's approach:**
- [Analyze what they did]
- [What was different from SENTINEL]

**AURORA's approach:**
- [Analyze what they did]
- [What was different from SENTINEL]

**Hypothesis:**
```
[Why did they get stuck repetition?]
- Incomplete lda fixes?
- Other bugs present at the time?
- Test methodology issues?
```
