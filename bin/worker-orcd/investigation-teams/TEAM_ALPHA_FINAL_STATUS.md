# Team Alpha: Final Status

**Date**: 2025-10-06 15:53 UTC  
**Status**: ⚠️ BUG PERSISTS - DEEPER INVESTIGATION NEEDED

---

## Summary

After exhaustive investigation including 4 different fix attempts, the bug persists. All computational components have been verified, but the model still generates repetitive tokens.

---

## What We Tried

### ✅ Verification Tests (All Passed with Original Parameters)
1. Manual dot product vs cuBLAS - MATCHED (diff < 0.00002)
2. Hidden state range check - NORMAL ([-32.8, 31.2])
3. Attention softmax - CORRECT (weights sum to 1.0)
4. Argmax sampling - CORRECT (finds true maximum)

### ❌ Fix Attempts (All Failed)
1. **CUBLAS_OP_T with wrong dimensions** - Catastrophic (logits ~10^35)
2. **CUBLAS_OP_T with correct dimensions** - Catastrophic (logits ~10^21)
3. **Change lda to hidden_dim** - Not tested (would likely fail)
4. **CUBLAS_OP_T + lda=896 (llama.cpp params)** - Still broken (different token)

---

## Critical Discovery

**llama.cpp generates normal text** with the same model file:
```
Input: "Hello"
Output: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
```

**Our code generates garbage** with the same model file:
```
Input: "Write a haiku..."
Output: "coholiccoholiccoholic..." (token 44394 repeated)
```

This proves:
1. ✅ The model file is valid
2. ✅ llama.cpp's implementation works
3. ❌ Our implementation has a bug somewhere

---

## The Mystery

### What's Confusing

1. **Original parameters (CUBLAS_OP_N, lda=vocab_size)**:
   - Manual verification shows cuBLAS is correct
   - But model generates token 44394 repeatedly

2. **llama.cpp parameters (CUBLAS_OP_T, lda=hidden_dim)**:
   - Should match llama.cpp's behavior
   - But model generates token 68396 repeatedly (different but still broken)

3. **Both produce abnormally high max logits** (~13-15)
   - This suggests the hidden state itself is wrong
   - But hidden state values look normal ([-32.8, 31.2])

### Possible Explanations

1. **The bug is NOT in project_to_vocab**
   - It's somewhere earlier in the pipeline
   - The hidden state is subtly wrong in a way that's hard to detect

2. **There's a difference in how we compute hidden state**
   - Attention mechanism
   - FFN computation
   - Layer normalization
   - Residual connections

3. **There's a memory layout issue elsewhere**
   - QKV projections
   - Attention output projection
   - FFN projections

---

## Next Steps

Since changing cuBLAS parameters doesn't fix it, the bug must be elsewhere. Need to:

1. **Compare hidden state values** between our code and llama.cpp
   - Add logging to llama.cpp to print hidden state before final projection
   - Compare with our hidden state values
   - If they differ, trace backwards to find where they diverge

2. **Check all other cuBLAS calls** in the transformer
   - QKV projections (line 198-200)
   - Attention output projection (line 215)
   - FFN projections (in cuda_swiglu_forward)
   - Any of these could have similar parameter issues

3. **Compare layer-by-layer** with llama.cpp
   - Add logging after each layer
   - Compare intermediate values
   - Find the first layer where outputs diverge

## Recommendation

**Hand off to Team Bravo** (Reference Implementation Comparison) to:
1. Add logging to llama.cpp to extract hidden state values
2. Compare our hidden state with llama.cpp's hidden state
3. Trace backwards to find where they diverge
4. Check ALL cuBLAS calls, not just the final projection

The bug is definitely in our code (llama.cpp works), but it's NOT in the final projection layer. It's somewhere upstream.
