# Team GREEN - Final Investigation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-06 20:54 UTC  
**Status:** ❌ **BUG NOT FIXED - FALSE LEAD DOCUMENTED**

---

## 🔍 What I Investigated

### Discovery: Q/K/V Biases Exist But Are All Zeros

**Initial Finding:**
- Model file contains `blk.0.attn_q.bias`, `blk.0.attn_k.bias`, `blk.0.attn_v.bias`
- We were setting them to `nullptr` and not using them
- llama.cpp DOES add these biases if they exist

**The "Fix" I Applied:**
1. Load biases from GPU pointers (instead of nullptr)
2. Add them after Q/K/V projections using `cuda_add_bias`
3. Added proper extern "C" declarations

**The Reality:**
```
[GREEN] Layer 0 Q bias[0..9]: 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000
```

**ALL BIASES ARE ZEROS!**

This means:
- ✅ The code change was correct (llama.cpp does this)
- ❌ But it has ZERO EFFECT on output (adding zeros changes nothing)
- ❌ This was NOT the root cause of garbage output

---

## ❌ FALSE LEADS DOCUMENTED

### False Lead #1: Missing Bias Addition
**Hypothesis:** We weren't adding Q/K/V biases  
**Investigation:** Added bias loading and addition code  
**Result:** Biases are all zeros, so this changed nothing  
**Time Spent:** ~30 minutes  
**Lesson:** Always check the actual values, not just the presence of tensors

### False Lead #2: Embedding Scaling
**Hypothesis:** llama.cpp might scale embeddings after lookup  
**Investigation:** Checked llama.cpp code  
**Result:** Only specific architectures (Granite, MiniCPM) use `f_embedding_scale`, Qwen2 doesn't  
**Time Spent:** ~10 minutes  
**Lesson:** Architecture-specific features don't apply to all models

## 🔥 The Bug Is STILL in the Forward Pass

**Current Symptoms (UNCHANGED):**
```
Output: çĤĬĠmilitĠmilitĠscarcityå¯¹å¤ĸå¼ĢæĶ¾Ġà¸ĺà¸±à¸Ļà¸§à¸²...
```

- Mojibake (Chinese/Thai/Korean tokens)
- Repetitive tokens ("Ġmilit" 2x, "ĠÐ»ÐµÑĩ" 10+x, "Ġconcise" 3x)
- High token IDs (119130, 110707, 142698 near vocab limit)

**Debug Output:**
```
[GREEN] Embedding output[0..9]: -0.0144 -0.0020 -0.0005 -0.0147 0.0293 0.0052 0.0315 -0.0135 0.0041 -0.0005
[GREEN] Layer 0 Q after bias[0..9]: -0.0715 0.1201 0.0423 0.0405 -0.1010 -0.0640 0.0091 0.0698 -0.0418 0.1003
```

Embedding values look reasonable (±0.03 range).  
Q values after projection look reasonable (±0.12 range).

## 🎯 Next Investigation Priorities

Since biases were a dead end, focus on:

### Priority 1: Compare Q/K/V with llama.cpp
Run llama.cpp with same prompt and compare Q/K/V values after projection.
Maybe our matrix multiplication is wrong despite passing verification?

### Priority 2: Check Attention Scores
Add logging to see attention scores before softmax.
Maybe the scores are wrong, causing wrong token selection?

### Priority 3: Check Final Logits Distribution
The logits look reasonable in range, but maybe the DISTRIBUTION is wrong?
High-ID tokens shouldn't have higher logits than low-ID English tokens.

### Priority 4: Systematic Binary Search
Since we can't find the bug by inspection, do binary search:
1. Copy hidden state after each layer
2. Compare with llama.cpp at each layer
3. Find EXACTLY where values diverge

## 📝 Files Modified (But No Effect)

1. **`cuda/src/model/qwen_weight_loader.cpp`** (lines 352-360)
   - Changed: Load biases instead of nullptr
   - Effect: None (biases are zeros)

2. **`cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`** (lines 114-121, 278-350)
   - Changed: Added bias addition after Q/K/V projections
   - Effect: None (biases are zeros)
   - Added: Debug logging to discover biases are zeros

3. **`cuda/kernels/gpt_ffn.cu`** (line 41)
   - Changed: Added extern "C" to cuda_add_bias
   - Effect: Code compiles, but function adds zeros

4. **`cuda/src/transformer/qwen_transformer.cpp`** (lines 1005-1015)
   - Added: Debug logging for embedding output
   - Effect: Confirmed embeddings look normal

## 🔑 Key Insights

### What I Learned

1. **Biases can exist but be unused:** The model file contains bias tensors, but they're all zeros. This is probably from the model training process where biases were initialized but never trained.

2. **llama.cpp's conditional bias addition is correct:** It checks `if (model.layers[il].bq)` before adding. If the bias is all zeros, adding it is a no-op, so it doesn't matter.

3. **The bug is subtle:** It's not a missing component or wrong parameter. Everything LOOKS correct, but produces wrong output. This suggests a subtle logic error or numerical issue.

### What the Next Team Should Do

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Re-investigate biases (they're zeros, confirmed)
- ❌ Re-investigate embedding scaling (Qwen2 doesn't use it)
- ❌ Re-investigate any component previous teams verified

**DO:**
- ✅ Add comparative logging at EVERY stage
- ✅ Run llama.cpp with SAME prompt and compare values
- ✅ Use binary search to find EXACT divergence point
- ✅ Check if there's a subtle bug in matrix layouts or indexing

## 💭 Final Thoughts

I spent significant time on the bias issue, which turned out to be a red herring. The biases exist in the model file, and my code changes were technically correct (llama.cpp does the same thing), but they had zero effect because the biases are all zeros.

**The real bug is still out there.** It's something subtle in the forward pass that causes logits to be corrupted, leading to selection of wrong tokens (mojibake, repetitive, high-ID tokens).

**My recommendation:** The next team should do a systematic comparison with llama.cpp, adding logging at every single step and comparing values until they find where our output diverges from llama.cpp's output.
