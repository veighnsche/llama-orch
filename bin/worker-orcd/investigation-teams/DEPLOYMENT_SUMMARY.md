## What Was Created

A parallel investigation framework with 5 specialized teams, each approaching the bug from a different angle.

## The 5 Teams

### üî¨ Team Alpha: Memory Layout Forensics
- **Specialty**: Memory architecture, CUDA memory models
- **Mission**: Map exact memory layout from GGUF ‚Üí GPU ‚Üí cuBLAS
- **Approach**: Trace memory addresses for failing positions (8850, 44394, 137131)
- **Key Deliverable**: Memory access diagram showing where mismatch occurs

### üîÑ Team Bravo: Reference Implementation Comparison
- **Specialty**: Comparative analysis, llama.cpp internals
- **Mission**: Extract exact parameters from working llama.cpp implementation
- **Approach**: Reverse engineer llama.cpp's cuBLAS call and compare with ours
- **Key Deliverable**: Parameter comparison table and identification of THE difference

### üìê Team Charlie: Mathematical Verification
- **Specialty**: Linear algebra, numerical methods
- **Mission**: Compute ground truth logits manually
- **Approach**: Manual dot product computation to establish correct answers
- **Key Deliverable**: Proof of correct values vs actual cuBLAS output

### üìä Team Delta: Instrumentation & Profiling
- **Specialty**: Debugging, profiling, runtime analysis
- **Mission**: Add comprehensive logging to trace data flow
- **Approach**: Instrument code with detailed printf/logging at key points
- **Key Deliverable**: Log analysis showing runtime behavior and patterns

### üìö Team Echo: First Principles Analysis
- **Specialty**: cuBLAS API, CUDA programming, documentation
- **Mission**: Derive correct parameters from cuBLAS documentation only
- **Approach**: Start from NVIDIA docs, build up correct understanding
- **Key Deliverable**: Mathematical derivation of correct parameters

## Why 5 Different Approaches?

Previous debugging attempts failed because they:
1. Made assumptions based on incomplete understanding
2. Tried random parameter changes without deep analysis
3. Didn't have enough evidence to justify the fix

By having 5 teams investigate independently:
- **Diverse perspectives** catch blind spots
- **Redundancy** ensures we don't miss the answer
- **Cross-validation** confirms findings are correct
- **Consensus** gives confidence in the fix

---

## Critical Rules for All Teams

### ‚úÖ DO (Encouraged!):
- **Add extensive logging** with your team prefix: `// [TEAM_X]`
- **Implement verification tests** to compute ground truth
- **Temporarily modify code** to test hypotheses and extract data
- **Run the test multiple times** to gather evidence
- **Copy GPU data to host** to inspect actual values
- **Document everything** in your RESULTS.md file

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BUT REMEMBER:
- **REVERT all temporary changes** after gathering data
- **Keep explanatory comments** (they're valuable!)
- **Don't commit test code** - only commit RESULTS.md and comments
- **Document what you changed** and what you learned

### Why This Approach?
You can't solve a bug by just reading code. You need **EVIDENCE** from runtime data. Change whatever you need to extract that evidence, just change it back when done.

---

## Workflow for Each Team

1. **Read your brief** (`TEAM_*_*.md`) - Understand your approach
2. **Read QUICK_START_GUIDE.md** - Learn how to add tests and extract data
3. **Add investigation code** - Logging, verification tests, data extraction
4. **Run the test** - Gather evidence from runtime behavior
5. **Analyze results** - What does the data tell you?
6. **Document findings** - Create `TEAM_*_RESULTS.md` with evidence
7. **Revert test code** - Keep comments, remove temporary changes
8. **Propose fix** - Specific parameter changes with justification

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Team investigations**: 1-2 hours each (can be parallel)
- **Results documentation**: 30-60 minutes each
- **Team sync meeting**: 1 hour (compare findings, reach consensus)
- **Implementation**: After consensus is reached

---

## The Bug (Recap)

**Symptom**: Model generates same token 100+ times  
**Root Cause**: Specific logit positions have garbage values (~14-15 instead of -4 to +4)  
**Affected Positions**: 8850, 44394, 137131 (and likely others)  
**Function**: `project_to_vocab` in `qwen_transformer.cpp` (cuBLAS GEMM call)  
**Hypothesis**: Row-major (GGUF) vs column-major (cuBLAS) memory layout mismatch  

---

## Success Criteria

Investigation succeeds when:

‚úÖ All teams identify the same root cause  
‚úÖ Root cause is explained with mathematical/technical evidence  
‚úÖ Proposed fix is specific (e.g., "change CUBLAS_OP_N to CUBLAS_OP_T")  
‚úÖ Fix is justified by at least 3 different analysis methods  
‚úÖ Teams can explain WHY only certain positions fail  

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy teams** - Assign engineers to each team
2. **Begin investigations** - Teams work independently
3. **Collect results** - Each team creates their RESULTS.md file
4. **Sync meeting** - Compare findings and reach consensus
5. **Implement fix** - Make the agreed-upon code change
6. **Test** - Verify the fix resolves the issue
