# 🎨 TEAM VAN GOGH - Weight Verification Chronicle

**Round:** 2  
**Specialization:** Weight Verification  
**Mission:** Resolve the output norm weight contradiction (16.75x amplification)  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR TEAM MONET

---

## 👥 Team Introduction

**Team Name:** VAN GOGH (after Vincent van Gogh, master of bold color and emotional truth)

**Why This Name:**
Van Gogh saw the world with intensity and painted what he felt, not just what he saw. TEAM VAN GOGH inspects weights with the same intensity, looking beyond surface values to understand their true impact.

**Team Philosophy:**
*"A weight is not just a number—it's a transformation."*

**Specialization:**
We are the weight inspectors. Round 1 left us with a contradiction:
- LAMINATOR: "16.75x amplification is INTENTIONAL"
- Output Norm Team: "16.75x amplification is a BUG"

One team said it's by design, another said it's corrupted. We'll find the truth by checking the model file, llama.cpp's behavior, and testing both approaches.

---

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Determine if 16.75x amplification is intentional or a bug

**Why This Matters:**
Output normalization is the LAST transformation before the LM head. If these weights are wrong, all the logits are wrong. This could explain repetitive tokens and abnormal output.

**Dependencies:**
- TEAM MONET (need to know current state)

**Teams Depending On Us:**
- TEAM REMBRANDT (needs our verdict to know what to restore)

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. Current State Analysis

**From TEAM MONET:**
- Weights: Normalized / Raw
- Applied by: TEAM [name]

### 2. GGUF Model Analysis

**Command:**
```bash
# Extract output_norm.weight from GGUF
[Your extraction method]
```

**Raw weights from file:**
- First 20 values: [list]
- Mean: ???
- Min: ???
- Max: ???
- Std dev: ???

**Analysis:**
- Normalized in file (mean≈1.0)? ✅ / ❌
- Raw in file (mean≈7.14)? ✅ / ❌

### 3. llama.cpp Behavior Analysis

**File checked:** `reference/llama.cpp/src/llama-model.cpp`

**Code snippet:**
```cpp
[Paste relevant code showing how llama.cpp handles output_norm.weight]
```

**Findings:**
- llama.cpp normalizes weights? ✅ / ❌
- llama.cpp uses raw weights? ✅ / ❌
- Line number: ???

### 4. End-to-End Test: Normalized Weights

**Changes made:**
```
[Describe how you ensured weights are normalized]
```

**Test command:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  --features cuda --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Results:**
- Output: [first 100 chars]
- Quality: ✅ Coherent / ❌ Garbage / ⚠️ Repetitive
- Hidden state range after norm: [min, max]
- Logit range: [min, max]
- Test: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### 5. End-to-End Test: Raw Weights

**Changes made:**
```
[Describe how you ensured weights are raw]
```

**Test command:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test --test haiku_generation_anti_cheat \
  --features cuda --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Results:**
- Output: [first 100 chars]
- Quality: ✅ Coherent / ❌ Garbage / ⚠️ Repetitive
- Hidden state range after norm: [min, max]
- Logit range: [min, max]
- Test: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### 6. llama.cpp Ground Truth

**Command:**
```bash
# Run llama.cpp with instrumentation to dump hidden states
[Your method]
```

**llama.cpp hidden state range:** [min, max]  
**llama.cpp logit range:** [min, max]

**Comparison:**
- Matches normalized approach? ✅ / ❌
- Matches raw approach? ✅ / ❌

## 🎯 Final Verdict

**The Correct Approach Is:**
- ✅ Normalized weights (mean=1.0)
- OR ✅ Raw weights (mean=7.14, max=16.75)
