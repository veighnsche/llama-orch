# 📝 TEAM FROST - Sampling Validation Chronicle

**Round:** 2  
**Specialization:** Sampling Verification  
**Mission:** Verify softmax and sampling fixes are working correctly  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR TEAM MONET

---

## 👥 Team Introduction

**Team Name:** FROST (after Robert Frost, master of precise observation)

**Why This Name:**
Frost's poetry captured nature with meticulous detail—"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood." TEAM FROST examines sampling with the same precision, verifying every probability, every distribution, every token selection.

**Team Philosophy:**
*"Sampling is where intelligence becomes choice."*

**Specialization:**
We are the sampling validators. The model can compute perfect logits, but if sampling is broken, it will still generate garbage. We verify:
- Softmax produces valid probabilities (sum=1.0, no zeros)
- Sampling order is correct (Top-P after softmax)
- Temperature/top-k work as expected
- No underflow issues remain

---

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Confirm CASCADE's softmax fix and HELIOS's sampling order fix are working

**Why This Matters:**
Round 1 found TWO critical sampling bugs:
1. Softmax underflow (CASCADE) - all probabilities became zero
2. Wrong sampling order (HELIOS) - Top-P before softmax instead of after

These were the FINAL bugs that prevented coherent output. We verify they're truly fixed.

**Dependencies:**
- TEAM MONET (need confirmation fixes are applied)

**Teams Depending On Us:**
- TEAM SHAKESPEARE (needs our verification for integration testing)

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. Softmax Output Verification

**Instrumentation added:**
```cpp
// Location: cuda/kernels/sampling.cu
// Code added:
[Paste instrumentation code]
```

**Test run:**
```bash
REQUIRE_REAL_LLAMA=1 cargo test ... --nocapture 2>&1 | grep SOFTMAX
```

**Results:**
- Sum of all probabilities: ??? (expected: 1.0)
- Diff from 1.0: ??? (expected: <1e-6)
- First 20 probabilities: [list]
- Number of zero probabilities: ??? (expected: 0)
- Minimum non-zero probability: ??? (expected: ~6.6e-6)

**Analysis:**
- All 151,936 probs > 0? ✅ / ❌
- Sum equals 1.0? ✅ / ❌
- CASCADE's fix working? ✅ / ❌

### 2. Sampling Order Verification

**Code inspection:**
```cpp
// Location: cuda/kernels/sampling_wrapper.cu
// Current order:
1. [step]
2. [step]
3. [step]
4. [step]
5. [step]
```

**Expected order (HELIOS's fix):**
1. Temperature scale
2. Top-K
3. Softmax
4. Top-P (if enabled)
5. Sample

**Verification:**
- Order matches HELIOS's fix? ✅ / ❌
- Top-P position: After softmax ✅ / Before softmax ❌

### 3. Temperature Scaling Test

**Test methodology:**
```bash
# Modified test to use different temperatures
# Ran with: 0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5
```

**Results:**

| Temperature | Output Diversity | Expected | Match? | Sample Output |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|--------|---------------|
| 0.1 | Low / Med / High | Low (peaked) | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 0.5 | Low / Med / High | Medium | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 0.7 | Low / Med / High | Medium | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 1.0 | Low / Med / High | High | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 1.5 | Low / Med / High | Very High | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |

**Analysis:**
- Temperature scaling works correctly? ✅ / ❌
- Lower temp = more deterministic? ✅ / ❌
- Higher temp = more diverse? ✅ / ❌

### 4. Top-K Filtering Test

**Test methodology:**
```bash
# Modified test to use different top-k values
# Ran with: 1, 10, 50, 100, 0 (disabled)
```

**Results:**

| Top-K | Behavior Observed | Expected | Match? | Sample Output |
|-------|------------------|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | [description] | Always max prob | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 10 | [description] | Top 10 only | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 50 | [description] | Top 50 only | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 100 | [description] | Top 100 only | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |
| 0 | [description] | No filtering | ✅ / ❌ | [first 30 chars] |

**Analysis:**
- Top-K filtering works correctly? ✅ / ❌
- top-k=1 always deterministic? ✅ / ❌

### 5. Comparison with llama.cpp

**Test setup:**
```bash
# Same seed, prompt, temp, top-k for both
SEED=12345
PROMPT="Write a haiku about GPU computing"
TEMP=0.7
TOP_K=0
```

**Our tokens (first 20):**
```
[List token IDs]
```

**llama.cpp tokens (first 20):**
```
[List token IDs]
```

**Comparison:**
- Exact match? ✅ / ❌
- Similar distribution? ✅ / ❌
- Explanation for differences: [if any]

### 6. Underflow Detection

**Instrumentation:**
```cpp
// Check for any probability being exactly 0.0
// (except for tokens filtered by top-k)
```

**Results:**
- Underflow detected? ✅ / ❌
- If yes, how many tokens? ???
- Minimum non-zero prob: ???
- Expected minimum: ~1/151936 = 6.6e-6

**Analysis:**
- No underflow issues? ✅ / ❌
- CASCADE's fix prevents underflow? ✅ / ❌
