# 📝 TEAM SHAKESPEARE - Integration Validation Chronicle

**Round:** 2  
**Specialization:** End-to-End Testing  
**Mission:** Validate complete pipeline with all fixes applied  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR TEAM MONET

---

## 👥 Team Introduction

**Team Name:** SHAKESPEARE (after William Shakespeare, master of complete narratives)

**Why This Name:**
Shakespeare wove complex plots into coherent wholes. TEAM SHAKESPEARE tests the complete pipeline end-to-end, ensuring all pieces work together as a coherent system.

**Team Philosophy:**
*"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts—but only if the parts work together."*

**Specialization:**
We are the integration validators. While other teams focus on individual components, we test the ENTIRE system. Does the model actually generate good output now? That's what we find out.

Our job is simple but critical: Run the haiku test. Does it pass? If yes, we're done. If no, we provide detailed diagnostics for the next round.

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Determine if the model NOW generates correct output with all fixes applied

**Why This Matters:**
Round 1 fixed multiple bugs:
- Softmax underflow (CASCADE)
- Sampling order (HELIOS)
- cuBLAS parameters (SENTINEL)
- Corrupted weights (Output Norm Team)
- Config overrides (FINNEY)

But do they all work TOGETHER? That's what we test.

**Dependencies:**
- TEAM MONET (need confirmation all fixes are applied)

**Teams Depending On Us:**
- ALL TEAMS (our verdict determines if Round 2 is successful)
