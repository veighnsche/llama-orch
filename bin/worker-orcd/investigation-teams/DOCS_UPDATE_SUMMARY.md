# Documentation Update Summary - Single-Threaded Runtime Discovery

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Updated By:** Team Picasso  
**Reason:** Align documentation with M0-W-1301 single-threaded runtime discovery

---

## üéØ What Changed

Team Picasso discovered that worker-orcd was using a **multi-threaded tokio runtime** by default, which violated the M0 spec requirement M0-W-1301:

> "Worker-orcd MUST process inference requests sequentially (one at a time)."

The fix was simple: change `#[tokio::main]` to `#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]` in `src/main.rs:61`.

This discovery had major implications for architecture and logging design, requiring documentation updates across the codebase.

## üìù Files Updated

### 1. `.docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated Executive Summary to include 3 key principles (was 1)
- Added "Problem 2: M0 Requires Sequential Execution" section
- Explained why single-threaded tokio runtime satisfies both async I/O and sequential execution requirements

**Key Addition:**
```
2. **Single-threaded execution** (M0-W-1301) - Worker processes requests 
   sequentially using tokio's `current_thread` runtime. No concurrent 
   inference, no thread pool overhead.
3. **Async for I/O, not compute** - Tokio provides non-blocking HTTP 
   handling via event loop. CUDA operations remain synchronous and sequential.
```

**Why:** Architecture doc is the authoritative source for design decisions. Must reflect actual implementation and spec compliance.

---

### 2. `.plan/foundation-team/sprints/sprint-1-http-foundation/done/FT-001-http-server-setup.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated acceptance criteria: "multi-threaded" ‚Üí "single-threaded per M0-W-1301"
- Added note explaining the correction timeline
- Updated implementation notes with threading model explanation
- Added "Threading Model" section with rationale and benefits

**Key Addition:**
```
**Threading Model** (Updated 2025-10-07):
- **Spec Requirement (M0-W-1301)**: Sequential execution, one request at a time
- **Initial Implementation**: Multi-threaded tokio runtime (spec violation)
- **Corrected Implementation**: Single-threaded `current_thread` runtime
- **Why Single-Threaded Works**: Tokio event loop handles HTTP I/O without 
  blocking, CUDA operations run sequentially on same thread
- **Benefits**: No thread pool overhead, simpler logging (no mutex), 
  matches llama.cpp architecture
```

**Why:** This story established the HTTP server foundation. Future readers need to understand why the async wrapper uses single-threaded runtime.

---

### 3. `.plan/foundation-team/sprints/sprint-1-http-foundation/SPEC_COMPLIANCE_REVIEW.md`

**Changes:**
- Added M0-W-1301 to FT-001 compliance table
- Added "Sequential execution" row with ‚úÖ COMPLIANT status
- Added "Threading Model Update" section explaining the correction

**Key Addition:**
```
| Sequential execution | M0-W-1301 | ‚úÖ `current_thread` tokio runtime (updated 2025-10-07) | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT |

**Threading Model Update (2025-10-07)**:
- Initial implementation used multi-threaded tokio runtime (spec violation)
- Corrected to single-threaded `current_thread` flavor per M0-W-1301
- Event loop provides non-blocking HTTP I/O while maintaining sequential CUDA execution
- Zero threading overhead, simpler logging architecture
```

**Why:** Spec compliance review is checked by future auditors. Must show we caught and fixed the violation.

### 4. `investigation-teams/PARITY_LOGGING_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated "Why llama.cpp Works" section to show worker-orcd is NOW THE SAME
- Rewrote "Design Principles" to contrast original over-engineered plan vs actual simple solution
- Updated architecture diagram to show simple buffer instead of lock-free queue
- Added explanations for why complex solution is no longer needed

**Key Addition:**
```
**ACTUAL SOLUTION** (Simple, matches llama.cpp + M0-W-1301):
1. ‚úÖ **Single-threaded runtime** (`current_thread` tokio) - No mutex needed
2. ‚úÖ **Simple vector append** - Just `entries.push_back(entry)`
3. ‚úÖ **Explicit flush** - Call `orch_log_flush_now()` after generation
4. ‚úÖ **Zero overhead** - Same as llama.cpp (< 0.01 Œºs/token)

**Why the simple solution works:**
- M0-W-1301 requires sequential execution (one request at a time)
- Single-threaded tokio runtime eliminates thread contention
- HTTP I/O handled by event loop (non-blocking, doesn't interfere)
- CUDA operations run sequentially on same thread as HTTP handlers
- No lock-free queue needed, no background thread needed, no atomics needed
```

**Why:** This document explained why complex logging was needed. Now that we're single-threaded, the simple solution works and the doc must reflect that.

## üîç Files NOT Updated (Intentionally)

### `investigation-teams/CRITICAL_FINDING_MULTITHREADING.md`

**Reason:** This is a **historical record** of Team Picasso's discovery. It should remain unchanged as evidence of the investigation process.

### `investigation-teams/TEAM_PICASSO_HTTP_FIX.md`

**Reason:** This is a **historical document** showing the investigation path. The HTTP fix was superseded by the single-threaded runtime discovery, but the document preserves the reasoning at that time.

### `investigation-teams/TEAM_PICASSO_CHRONICLE.md`

**Reason:** This is a **timestamped investigation log**. Changing it would falsify the historical record.

## üìö Key Takeaways for Future Readers

1. **worker-orcd uses single-threaded tokio runtime** - This is intentional and spec-compliant (M0-W-1301)

2. **Async ‚â† Multi-threaded** - Tokio's event loop provides non-blocking I/O on a single thread

3. **HTTP works with single-threaded runtime** - Event loop handles I/O concurrency without thread pool

4. **CUDA stays sequential** - All GPU operations run one at a time on the same thread as HTTP handlers

5. **Simple logging works** - No mutex, no atomics, no background threads needed (like llama.cpp)
