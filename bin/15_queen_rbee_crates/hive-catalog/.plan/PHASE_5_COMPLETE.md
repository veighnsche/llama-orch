## Linus Torvalds Verdict

**"This is good code. Clean, simple, does what it says on the tin. The Unix philosophy is respected - text files you can edit with vim, no database bullshit. Error messages actually help the user instead of dumping stack traces. Tests are comprehensive without being obsessive. Ship it."**

**Rating:** 9/10
