# Phase 5: Code Peer Review

**Team:** TEAM-192  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 (TEAM-191) complete  
**Deliverables:** Comprehensive code review, bug fixes, quality improvements

---

## Mission

Conduct a thorough peer review of all changes from Phases 1-4. Verify correctness, identify edge cases, improve error handling, and ensure code quality standards are met.

## Review Checklist

### 5.1 Code Quality Review

#### Rust Best Practices
- [ ] All functions have proper error handling (no unwrap/expect in production code)
- [ ] Result types are used consistently
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and actionable
- [ ] No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy --all-targets`)
- [ ] Code follows rustfmt style (`cargo fmt --check`)
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] Proper use of lifetimes and ownership

#### Documentation
- [ ] All public functions have doc comments
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments
- [ ] README.md files are up to date
- [ ] Examples are provided where helpful
- [ ] Error types are documented

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests cover happy paths
- [ ] Unit tests cover error cases
- [ ] Integration tests exist for critical flows
- [ ] Test fixtures are realistic
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)

### 5.2 Security Review

#### File System Security
- [ ] Config directory permissions are checked
- [ ] File paths are validated (no path traversal)
- [ ] Symlinks are handled safely
- [ ] Temp files are cleaned up properly

#### Input Validation
- [ ] User input is validated before use
- [ ] Port numbers are in valid range (1-65535)
- [ ] Hostnames are validated
- [ ] Aliases don't contain special characters

#### SSH Security
- [ ] SSH connections use proper authentication
- [ ] SSH keys are handled securely
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Timeouts are set for SSH operations

### 5.3 Functional Review

#### Config Parser
- [ ] SSH config syntax is parsed correctly
- [ ] Comments are handled properly
- [ ] Unknown fields are ignored gracefully
- [ ] Required fields are validated
- [ ] Duplicate aliases are detected
- [ ] Empty files are handled

#### Capabilities Cache
- [ ] YAML is generated with proper formatting
- [ ] Auto-generated header is present
- [ ] Timestamps are in correct format
- [ ] Cache is updated atomically (no partial writes)
- [ ] Stale cache entries are handled

#### Hive Operations
- [ ] Install checks for existing hives
- [ ] Uninstall cleans up all resources
- [ ] Start/stop are idempotent
- [ ] Health checks have timeouts
- [ ] Capabilities fetch has retry logic

### 5.4 Edge Cases Review

#### Config Files
- [ ] Missing config directory is created
- [ ] Missing config files are handled gracefully
- [ ] Malformed YAML/TOML is caught with clear errors
- [ ] Empty hives.conf is valid
- [ ] Very large config files are handled

#### Network Issues
- [ ] Connection timeouts are handled
- [ ] DNS resolution failures are handled
- [ ] Port conflicts are detected
- [ ] Firewall blocks are reported clearly

#### Process Management
- [ ] Zombie processes are prevented
- [ ] Process crashes are detected
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works
- [ ] SIGTERM/SIGINT are handled

#### Concurrent Operations
- [ ] Multiple hive installs don't conflict
- [ ] Config reloads are thread-safe
- [ ] Capabilities updates are atomic

### 5.5 Error Message Review

Check that all error messages:
- [ ] Are user-friendly (not just debug output)
- [ ] Suggest next steps
- [ ] Include relevant context (alias, path, etc.)
- [ ] Don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Are consistent in tone and format

**Examples of good error messages:**

```
‚ùå Hive alias 'workstation' not found in hives.conf.

Available hives:
  - localhost
  - gpu-cloud

Add 'workstation' to ~/.config/rbee/hives.conf to use it.
```

```
‚ùå Failed to connect to hive at http://localhost:8081

Possible causes:
  - Hive is not running (start it with: ./rbee hive start -h localhost)
  - Port 8081 is blocked by firewall
  - Hive crashed during startup (check logs)
```

### 5.6 Performance Review

- [ ] Config loading is fast (< 100ms for typical configs)
- [ ] No unnecessary file I/O
- [ ] Capabilities cache is used instead of repeated API calls
- [ ] No busy loops or polling without delays
- [ ] Async operations use tokio properly

### 5.7 Narration Review

Check that narration messages:
- [ ] Are emitted at key milestones
- [ ] Use appropriate emojis consistently
- [ ] Provide progress updates for long operations
- [ ] Don't spam the user with too many messages
- [ ] Are helpful for debugging
