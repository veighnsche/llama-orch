# Hive Catalog ‚Üí File-Based Config Migration

**Mission:** Eliminate SQLite-based `hive-catalog` and replace with file-based configuration following Unix best practices.

## The Problem

Currently, hive registration uses SQLite (`hive-catalog` crate), which is:
- ‚ùå Over-engineered for simple config storage
- ‚ùå Requires programmatic editing via CLI
- ‚ùå Not transparent to users
- ‚ùå Doesn't follow standard Unix config patterns

## The Solution

Replace with **file-based configuration**:

```
~/.config/rbee/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml          # Queen-level config (queen port, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hives.conf           # SSH/hive definitions (SSH config style)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ capabilities.yaml    # Auto-generated device capabilities
```

## Key Changes

### Before
```bash
rbee hive install --id my-hive --ssh-host 192.168.1.100 --ssh-user admin
# Writes to SQLite database
```

### After
```bash
# 1. User manually edits ~/.config/rbee/hives.conf:
Host workstation
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    Port 22
    User admin
    HivePort 8081

# 2. Install using alias:
rbee hive install -h workstation
```

## Team Assignments

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL NOTE:** Phase 1 was accidentally completed as TEAM-193 (not TEAM-188)!  
**All subsequent teams: ADD 5 to your phase number to get your REAL team number!**

| Phase | Team | **ACTUAL TEAM** | Focus | Duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | ~~TEAM-188~~ | **TEAM-193** ‚úÖ DONE | Config file design & parser | 4-6h |
| Phase 2 | ~~TEAM-189~~ | **TEAM-194** ‚úÖ DONE | Replace SQLite in job_router | 6-8h |
| Phase 3 | ~~TEAM-190~~ | **TEAM-195** ‚úÖ DONE | Preflight validation | 3-4h |
| Phase 4 | ~~TEAM-191~~ | **TEAM-196** ‚úÖ DONE | Capabilities auto-generation | 4-5h |
| Phase 5 | ~~TEAM-192~~ | **TEAM-197** ‚úÖ DONE | Code peer review | 2-3h |
| Phase 6 | ~~TEAM-193~~ | **TEAM-198** ‚úÖ DONE | Documentation | 2-3h |
| Phase 7 | ~~TEAM-194~~ | **TEAM-199** | Self-destruct (delete hive-catalog) | 1-2h |

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ No SQLite dependencies
- ‚úÖ Users manually edit `hives.conf`
- ‚úÖ Alias-based hive operations
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated capabilities cache
- ‚úÖ Preflight validation on queen startup
- ‚úÖ `hive-catalog` crate deleted
