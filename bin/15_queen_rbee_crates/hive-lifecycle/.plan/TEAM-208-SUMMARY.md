## Analysis Summary

### Current State
- **File:** `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs`
- **Size:** 1,115 LOC
- **Problem:** Mixed routing and hive lifecycle logic
- **Maintainability:** Poor (too big, hard to test)

### Target State
- **File:** `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs`
- **Size:** ~350 LOC (routing only)
- **New Crate:** `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/`
- **Size:** ~900 LOC (all hive operations)
- **Maintainability:** Excellent (clean separation)

### LOC Breakdown

**Operations to Migrate:**
- SshTest: Already in crate ✅
- HiveInstall: 121 LOC
- HiveUninstall: 82 LOC
- HiveStart: 232 LOC (most complex)
- HiveStop: 102 LOC

## Team Assignments

| Team | Phase | Task | LOC | Dependencies |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------------|
| TEAM-210 | 1 | Foundation | ~150 | None |
| TEAM-211 | 2 | Simple Ops | ~100 | TEAM-210 |
| TEAM-212 | 3 | Lifecycle Core | ~350 | TEAM-210 |

## Critical Requirements Highlighted

### 1. SSE Routing (CRITICAL!)
All narration MUST include `.job_id(&job_id)` for SSE routing.

**Documented in:**
- Every phase document
- START_HERE.md
- Master plan

**Why Critical:**
Without job_id, events are dropped by SSE sink. Users won't see progress.

### 2. Error Messages
Preserve exact error messages from original code.

**Documented in:**
- Every phase document
- Peer review checklist

**Why Critical:**
Users rely on these messages. Changes cause confusion.

### 3. Code Signatures
Add TEAM-XXX signatures to all new/modified code.

**Documented in:**
- Engineering rules
- Every phase document

**Why Critical:**
Historical context for future teams.

---

## Workflow Design

### Sequential Phases
1. **TEAM-210** (Foundation) - Blocks everyone
2. **TEAM-211-214** (Implementation) - Can work in parallel
3. **TEAM-215** (Integration) - Waits for all implementation
4. **TEAM-209** (Peer Review) - Final gate

### Parallel Work Enabled
After TEAM-210 completes:
- TEAM-211, 212, 213, 214 can work simultaneously
- Each team has independent modules
- No conflicts expected

### Quality Gates
- Each phase has acceptance criteria
- TEAM-209 performs final peer review
- Approval required before merge

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **LOC Reduction:** 65% (1,115 → 350)
- **Operations Migrated:** 9 operations
- **Code Deleted:** ~724 LOC
- **Code Added:** ~900 LOC (in new crate)

### Qualitative
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable hive operations
- Maintainable codebase
- No regressions

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: SSE Routing Breaks
**Mitigation:** Emphasized in every document, peer review checklist

### Risk 2: Error Messages Change
**Mitigation:** Explicit requirement to preserve exact messages

### Risk 3: Capabilities Caching Breaks
**Mitigation:** Test cache hit/miss paths in peer review

### Risk 4: Process Management Issues
**Mitigation:** Follow daemon-lifecycle patterns exactly

---

- TEAM-215: 1 day
- TEAM-209: 0.5 days
- **Total:** ~5-6 days

- TEAM-211-214: 4-5 days (parallel)
- TEAM-215: 2 days
- TEAM-209: 1 day
- **Total:** ~9-10 days

### Conservative (Careful Teams)
- TEAM-210: 3 days

## Final Notes

### What TEAM-208 Did
- ✅ Analyzed job_router.rs (1,115 LOC)
- ✅ Identified operations to migrate (~724 LOC)
- ✅ Designed module structure
- ✅ Created 7 phase plans
- ✅ Assigned teams (TEAM-209 through TEAM-215)
- ✅ Documented critical requirements
- ✅ Created entry point guide

### What TEAM-208 Did NOT Do
- ❌ Implementation (that's for TEAM-210-215)
- ❌ Testing (that's for each team + TEAM-209)
- ❌ Code changes (planning only)

### Why This Approach Works
1. **Clear Phases:** Each team knows exactly what to do
2. **Parallel Work:** Teams 211-214 can work simultaneously
3. **Quality Gates:** Peer review ensures correctness
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Critical issues identified upfront
5. **Measurable Success:** LOC reduction is quantifiable

**Ready for:** TEAM-210 to start Phase 1 (Foundation)

---

**Created by:** TEAM-208
