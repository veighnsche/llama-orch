# TEAM-209: Phase 7 - Peer Review

**Assigned to:** TEAM-209  
**Depends on:** TEAM-210, TEAM-211, TEAM-212, TEAM-213, TEAM-214, TEAM-215  
**Blocks:** None (final phase)  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

---

## Mission

**CRITICAL PEER REVIEW** of the entire hive-lifecycle migration.

This is NOT implementation work. This is QUALITY ASSURANCE.

Your job is to find problems, verify correctness, and ensure no regressions.

---

## TEAM-209 EXECUTION STATUS

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Reviewer:** TEAM-209  
**Status:** ❌ **PLANNING PHASE - NO IMPLEMENTATION DONE YET**

### Current Reality Check

```bash
# Actual LOC counts (verified):
wc -l bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs
  1114 bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs  # ❌ Still contains ALL hive logic

wc -l bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/lib.rs
  155 bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/lib.rs  # ❌ Only SSH test

find bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src -name "*.rs"
  # Result: ONLY lib.rs exists
  # ❌ NO start.rs, stop.rs, list.rs, get.rs, status.rs, etc.
```

### Migration Status: 0% Complete

- ❌ **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Not started
- ❌ **Phase 2 (Simple Operations):** Not started  
- ❌ **Phase 3 (Lifecycle Core):** Not started
- ❌ **Phase 4 (Install/Uninstall):** Not started
- ❌ **Phase 5 (Capabilities):** Not started
- ❌ **Phase 6 (Integration):** Not started
- ✅ **Phase 7 (Peer Review):** IN PROGRESS (this document)

**⚠️  CRITICAL:** This peer review is happening BEFORE implementation, not after!

I'm reviewing the PLANS for correctness, not reviewing completed work.

## Testing Commands

### Build and Check
```bash
# Clean build
cargo clean
cargo build --bin rbee-keeper --bin queen-rbee --bin rbee-hive

# Check for warnings
cargo check --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test all operations
./rbee hive list
./rbee hive install
./rbee hive start
./rbee hive status
./rbee hive refresh
./rbee hive stop
./rbee hive get localhost

# Test error cases
./rbee hive start --host nonexistent
./rbee hive status --host nonexistent
```

### SSE Testing
```bash
# Start queen and watch SSE stream
./rbee hive start --verbose

# Check for narration events in output
# All events should include job_id
# Timeout countdown should be visible
```

### LOC Verification
```bash
# Check LOC reduction
wc -l bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs
# Should be ~350 LOC (was 1,115)

wc -l bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/*.rs
# Should be ~900 LOC total
```

## Engineering Rules Compliance

From `engineering-rules.md`:

- [ ] No TODO markers in delivered code
- [ ] All code has TEAM-XXX signatures
- [ ] No multiple .md files for one task
- [ ] Handoffs ≤2 pages
- [ ] Actual progress shown (LOC migrated)
- [ ] No "next team should implement X"

---

## Final Checklist

Before approving:
- [ ] Read all phase documents (01-06)
- [ ] Review all code changes
- [ ] Test all operations
- [ ] Verify SSE routing
- [ ] Check error messages
- [ ] Measure LOC reduction
- [ ] Write review report
- [ ] Document issues (if any)
- [ ] Make approval decision

---

**Remember:** Your job is to find problems, not to fix them. Be thorough. Be critical. Be honest.

If you find critical issues, REJECT the migration and send it back to the appropriate team.

If you find minor issues, document them and decide if they block approval.

If everything looks good, APPROVE the migration.

## TEAM-209 PLAN REVIEW SUMMARY

Since NO implementation has been done, I reviewed the PLANS themselves for:
1. ✅ Accuracy of LOC counts
2. ✅ Completeness of architecture understanding
3. ✅ Missing dependencies or modules
4. ✅ Gaps in error handling
5. ✅ Unrealistic expectations

**See:** `TEAM_209_CHANGELOG.md` for complete findings
