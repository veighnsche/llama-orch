//! Heartbeat HTTP endpoints

//! TEAM-186: Heartbeat handling for queen-rbee
//! TEAM-186: Changed from catalog to registry (heartbeat is runtime data)
//! TEAM-186: Added new hive discovery workflow
//! TEAM-217: Investigated Oct 22, 2025 - Behavior inventory complete
//! TEAM-261: Added worker heartbeat endpoint (workers send directly to queen)
//!
//! **Heartbeat flows:**
//! 1. Hive heartbeat (DEPRECATED - will be removed)
//! 2. Worker heartbeat (NEW - workers send directly to queen)
