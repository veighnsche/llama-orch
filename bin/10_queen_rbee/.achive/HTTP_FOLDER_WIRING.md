# queen-rbee HTTP Folder Wiring Complete

**TEAM-151 Progress Report**  
**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ✅ Health Endpoint Wired from src/http/ folder

---

## ✅ What Was Done

Successfully wired up the health endpoint using the **existing `src/http/` folder structure** that you copied from old.queen-rbee.

### File Structure

```
bin/10_queen_rbee/src/
├── main.rs                 ✅ Uses http module
└── http/
    ├── mod.rs              ✅ Exports health module
    ├── health.rs           ✅ handle_health() handler
    ├── types.rs            ✅ HealthResponse struct
    ├── beehives.rs         ⏳ Commented out (needs registries)
    ├── workers.rs          ⏳ Commented out (needs registries)
    ├── inference.rs        ⏳ Commented out (needs registries)
    ├── routes.rs           ⏳ Commented out (needs registries)
    └── middleware/         ⏳ Commented out (needs auth)
```

---

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### 1. main.rs Integration

**Added:**
```rust
mod http;  // Import the http module

fn create_simple_router() -> axum::Router {
    axum::Router::new()
        .route("/health", get(http::health::handle_health))
}
```

### 2. http/mod.rs (Module Configuration)

**Active modules:**
```rust
pub mod health;   // ✅ ACTIVE
pub mod types;    // ✅ ACTIVE (only HealthResponse)
```

**Commented out (need registries):**
```rust
// pub mod beehives;    // needs beehive_registry
// pub mod workers;     // needs worker_registry
// pub mod inference;   // needs registries
// pub mod routes;      // needs registries
// pub mod middleware;  // needs auth_min
```

### 3. http/types.rs (Simplified)

**Kept only:**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct HealthResponse {
    pub status: String,
    pub version: String,
}
```

**Commented out:** All other types that depend on `BeehiveNode`, `WorkerRegistry`, etc.

### 4. http/health.rs (Unchanged)

Uses the handler from the copied folder:
```rust
pub async fn handle_health() -> impl IntoResponse {
    Json(HealthResponse {
        status: "ok".to_string(),
        version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").to_string(),
    })
}
```

## ✅ Test Results

### Compilation
```bash
cargo build --bin queen-rbee
# ✅ Success - 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

### Server Startup
```bash
./target/debug/queen-rbee --port 8500
# Output:
# 🐝 queen-rbee Orchestrator Daemon starting...
# Port: 8500
# ✅ HTTP server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8500
# ✅ Health endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8500/health
# 🚀 queen-rbee is ready to accept connections
```

### Health Endpoint Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:8500/health
# Response:
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "version": "0.1.0"
# }
```

## 🔄 Next Steps: Uncomment Other Endpoints

To activate the other endpoints in the http folder, you need to migrate these dependencies:

### 1. Beehive Registry (`beehives.rs`)
**Needs:**
- `beehive_registry` module (from old.queen-rbee/src/beehive_registry.rs)
- `input_validation` crate (shared)
- `ssh` module (from old.queen-rbee/src/ssh.rs)
- `chrono` crate

**Then uncomment in http/mod.rs:**
```rust
pub mod beehives;
```

### 2. Worker Registry (`workers.rs`)
**Needs:**
- `worker_registry` module (from old.queen-rbee/src/worker_registry.rs)

**Then uncomment in http/mod.rs:**
```rust
pub mod workers;
```

### 3. Inference (`inference.rs`)
**Needs:**
- Both registries (beehive + worker)
- `input_validation` crate
- `deadline_propagation` crate
- `reqwest` crate

**Then uncomment in http/mod.rs:**
```rust
pub mod inference;
```

### 4. Middleware (`middleware/auth.rs`)
**Needs:**
- `auth_min` crate (shared)
- Both registries
- `audit_logging` crate

**Then uncomment in http/mod.rs:**
```rust
pub mod middleware;
```

### 5. Routes (`routes.rs`)
**Needs:**
- All of the above
- Full `AppState` with registries + audit logger

**Then uncomment in http/mod.rs:**
```rust
pub mod routes;
pub use routes::{create_router, AppState};
```

**And in main.rs, replace `create_simple_router()` with:**
```rust
let app = http::create_router(
    beehive_registry,
    worker_registry,
    expected_token,
    audit_logger,
);
```

## 📊 Migration Status

### ✅ Complete
- [x] Health endpoint wired from src/http/health.rs
- [x] HealthResponse type from src/http/types.rs
- [x] HTTP module structure integrated into main.rs
- [x] Clean compilation with no warnings
- [x] Health endpoint tested and working

### ⏳ Pending (Blocked by Registry Migration)
- [ ] beehives.rs endpoints
- [ ] workers.rs endpoints
- [ ] inference.rs endpoints
- [ ] middleware/auth.rs
- [ ] routes.rs full router
- [ ] types.rs other types

---

## 🎯 Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Uses Existing HTTP Folder
- Respects your copied folder structure
- Health endpoint uses src/http/health.rs (not the crate)
- Types use src/http/types.rs (not the crate)
- Ready to uncomment other modules as registries are migrated

### ✅ Minimal Binary Pattern
- main.rs only contains server setup
- All HTTP logic in src/http/ folder
- Clean module boundaries

### ✅ Happy Flow Ready
- Health endpoint works on port 8500
- rbee-keeper can now check if queen is running
- Next: Implement rbee-keeper-queen-lifecycle to auto-start queen

## 📝 Files Modified

**Updated:**
- ✅ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/main.rs` (added `mod http`, uses http::health)
- ✅ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/mod.rs` (commented out modules needing registries)
- ✅ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/types.rs` (kept only HealthResponse)
- ✅ `bin/10_queen_rbee/Cargo.toml` (added serde, serde_json)

**Unchanged (ready to use):**
- ✅ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/health.rs` (works as-is)
- ⏳ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/beehives.rs` (needs registries)
- ⏳ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/workers.rs` (needs registries)
- ⏳ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/inference.rs` (needs registries)
- ⏳ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/routes.rs` (needs registries)
- ⏳ `bin/10_queen_rbee/src/http/middleware/` (needs auth)

**The http folder is now properly wired!** The health endpoint works, and other endpoints are ready to be uncommented once the registries are migrated.
