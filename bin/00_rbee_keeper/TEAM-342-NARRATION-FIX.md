# TEAM-342: Localhost Hive Narration Fix

**Date:** Oct 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Problem

The localhost hive status checker was not producing any narration events, making it impossible to see what was happening in the UI.

## Root Cause

The `hive_status` Tauri command was calling `check_daemon_health()` which is a **silent utility function** - it doesn't emit any narration by design. The only narration came from `check_binary_installed()` which is only called when the daemon is **not running**.

**Result:** If the hive was running, NO narration was emitted at all.

## The Fix

**File:** `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/tauri_commands.rs`

Added narration to the `hive_status` command:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
#[specta::specta]
pub async fn hive_status(alias: String) -> Result<daemon_lifecycle::DaemonStatus, String> {
    use observability_narration_core::n;

    // TEAM-342: Narrate status check start
    n!("hive_status_check", "🔍 Checking status for hive '{}'", alias);

    // ... resolve SSH config and check health ...

    let status = check_daemon_health(&health_url, "rbee-hive", &ssh).await;

    // TEAM-342: Narrate status result
    if status.is_running {
        n!("hive_status_running", "✅ Hive '{}' is running", alias);
    } else if status.is_installed {
        n!("hive_status_stopped", "⏸️  Hive '{}' is installed but not running", alias);
    } else {
        n!("hive_status_not_installed", "❌ Hive '{}' is not installed", alias);
    }

    Ok(status)
}
```

## Narration Events Emitted

1. **Start:** `🔍 Checking status for hive 'localhost'`
2. **Result (one of):**
   - `✅ Hive 'localhost' is running` (if running)
   - `⏸️  Hive 'localhost' is installed but not running` (if stopped)
   - `❌ Hive 'localhost' is not installed` (if not installed)

## Why This Matters

- ✅ Users can now see status checks happening in real-time
- ✅ Narration panel shows what's being checked
- ✅ Clear feedback on hive state (running/stopped/not installed)
- ✅ Consistent with other daemon operations (queen_status, hive_start, etc.)

## Verification

```bash
cargo check --bin rbee-keeper
# ✅ Exit code: 0 (compilation successful)
```

## Testing

1. Start rbee-keeper UI
2. Navigate to Services page
3. Localhost hive card should trigger status check
4. Narration panel should show:
   - "🔍 Checking status for hive 'localhost'"
   - Status result (running/stopped/not installed)

## Related Files

- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/tauri_commands.rs` (fixed - added narration)
- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/status.rs` (check_daemon_health - silent by design)
- `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-lifecycle/src/utils/binary.rs` (check_binary_installed - has narration)

## Pattern for Future

**When wrapping daemon-lifecycle functions in Tauri commands:**
- ✅ Always add narration at the Tauri command level
- ✅ Narrate the START of the operation
- ✅ Narrate the RESULT of the operation
- ✅ Use descriptive action names (e.g., `hive_status_check`, `hive_status_running`)
- ✅ Include the alias/identifier in the message for clarity

**daemon-lifecycle functions are intentionally silent** - they're utility functions. Narration should be added at the integration layer (Tauri commands, CLI handlers, etc.).
