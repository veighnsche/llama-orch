# TEAM-135: Placeholder feature for rbee-keeper binary
# TODO: Replace with actual integration test features

Feature: rbee-keeper binary integration
  As a developer
  I want integration tests for rbee-keeper
  So that the binary behavior is verified

  Scenario: Binary placeholder test
    Given the rbee-keeper binary is available
    When I run integration tests
    Then the test harness should be ready
