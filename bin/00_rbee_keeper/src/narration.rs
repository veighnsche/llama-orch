// TEAM-191: Narration Macro Setup
// ============================================================================

/// Create the narrate! macro with rbee-keeper's actor baked in.
///
/// This allows ergonomic narration throughout rbee-keeper without repeating the actor.
///
/// # Usage
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::narration::narrate;
///
/// narrate!(ACTION_QUEEN_START, "queen-rbee")
///     .human("üöÄ Starting queen-rbee")
///     .emit();
/// ```
///
/// # TEAM-191: Ultimate Ergonomics!
/// This pattern is inspired by `println!` - define once, use everywhere.
