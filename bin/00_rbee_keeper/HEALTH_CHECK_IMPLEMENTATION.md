# rbee-keeper Health Check Implementation

**TEAM-151 Progress Report**  
**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Added health check functionality to rbee-keeper so it can detect if queen-rbee is running.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`src/health_check.rs`** (NEW)
   - `is_queen_healthy()` function
   - Returns `Ok(true)` if queen is running
   - Returns `Ok(false)` if connection refused (queen is off)
   - 500ms timeout for quick response

2. **`src/main.rs`** (UPDATED)
   - Added `mod health_check`
   - New command: `test-health`
   - Wired up health check with nice output

3. **`Cargo.toml`** (UPDATED)
   - Added `reqwest` dependency for HTTP calls

## 🎯 Happy Flow Integration

From `a_human_wrote_this.md` line 9:
> **"bee keeper first tests if queen is running? by calling the health."**

### Implementation

```rust
pub async fn is_queen_healthy(base_url: &str) -> Result<bool> {
    let health_url = format!("{}/health", base_url);
    
    let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
        .timeout(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500))
        .build()?;
    
    match client.get(&health_url).send().await {
        Ok(response) => Ok(response.status().is_success()),
        Err(e) if e.is_connect() => Ok(false), // Connection refused
        Err(e) => Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Health check failed: {}", e))
    }
}
```

## ✅ Test Results

### Test 1: Queen is OFF (Connection Refused)

```bash
./target/debug/rbee-keeper test-health
# Output:
# 🔍 Testing queen-rbee health at http://localhost:8500
# ❌ queen-rbee is not running (connection refused)
#    Start queen with: queen-rbee --port 8500
```

### Test 2: Queen is ON (Healthy)

```bash
# Start queen
./target/debug/queen-rbee --port 8500 &

# Test health
./target/debug/rbee-keeper test-health
# Output:
# 🔍 Testing queen-rbee health at http://localhost:8500
# ✅ queen-rbee is running and healthy
```

### Test 3: Custom URL

```bash
./target/debug/rbee-keeper test-health --queen-url http://localhost:9999
# Output:
# 🔍 Testing queen-rbee health at http://localhost:9999
# ❌ queen-rbee is not running (connection refused)
#    Start queen with: queen-rbee --port 8500
```

---

## 📊 Command Usage

```bash
# Test with default URL (http://localhost:8500)
rbee-keeper test-health

# Test with custom URL
rbee-keeper test-health --queen-url http://localhost:8500

# Show help
rbee-keeper test-health --help
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

Now that rbee-keeper can check if queen is running, the next step is:

### **rbee-keeper-queen-lifecycle Crate**

**Purpose:** Auto-start queen if health check fails

**Required Function:**
```rust
pub async fn ensure_queen_running(base_url: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Check health using health_check::is_queen_healthy()
    if is_queen_healthy(base_url).await? {
        return Ok(()); // Already running
    }
    
    // 2. Start queen using daemon-lifecycle crate
    println!("⚠️  queen-rbee not running, starting...");
    spawn_queen_process().await?;
    
    // 3. Poll health until ready
    poll_until_healthy(base_url, Duration::from_secs(30)).await?;
    
    println!("✅ queen-rbee is awake and healthy");
    Ok(())
}
```

**Dependencies Needed:**
- `daemon-lifecycle` (shared crate) - spawn queen process
- `rbee-keeper-polling` (keeper crate) - retry logic with exponential backoff

## 🎯 Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Hardcoded Port
- Queen URL: `http://localhost:8500` (default)
- Matches architecture docs (NOT :8080 from old code!)

### ✅ Quick Timeout
- 500ms timeout for fast failure detection
- No hanging if queen is down

### ✅ Clear Narration
- ✅ "queen-rbee is running and healthy"
- ❌ "queen-rbee is not running (connection refused)"
- ⚠️ "Health check error" (for other errors)

### ✅ Helpful Messages
- Tells user how to start queen if it's not running
- Shows which URL was tested

---

## 📝 Code Quality

### Clean Implementation
- Separate module (`health_check.rs`)
- Simple, focused function
- Good error handling
- Unit test included

### User-Friendly CLI
- New `test-health` command for debugging
- Optional `--queen-url` parameter
- Clear emoji-based output

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ rbee-keeper can check if queen is running
- ✅ Detects connection refused (queen is off)
- ✅ Detects 200 OK (queen is on)
- ✅ Fast timeout (500ms)
- ✅ Hardcoded port 8500
- ✅ Clear user feedback
- ✅ Ready for lifecycle integration

---

**Next:** Implement `rbee-keeper-queen-lifecycle` crate to auto-start queen when health check fails.
