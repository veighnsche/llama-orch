# 📦 Localhost Install Option (TEAM-360)

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Team:** TEAM-360  
**Purpose:** Add localhost to install dropdown when not installed

---

## **Problem**

Localhost was **excluded from the install dropdown**, even when not installed.

### **Old Logic (Wrong):**
```typescript
// TEAM-350: Filter out already installed hives AND localhost
const availableHives = hives.filter(
  (hive: SshHive) => !installedHives.includes(hive.host) && hive.host !== 'localhost'
  //                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //                                                        ❌ Always excluded localhost
);
```

**Result:** Users couldn't install localhost from the UI.

---

## **The Fix**

### **New Logic (Correct):**
```typescript
// TEAM-360: Filter out already installed hives (include localhost if not installed)
const availableHives = hives.filter(
  (hive: SshHive) => !installedHives.includes(hive.host)
  //                 ✅ Only filter installed hives, localhost included if not installed
);
```

---

## **Behavior**

### **When Localhost NOT Installed:**
- ✅ Localhost appears in install dropdown
- ✅ User can select and install localhost
- ✅ After install, localhost card appears (TEAM-359)

### **When Localhost IS Installed:**
- ❌ Localhost NOT in install dropdown (already installed)
- ✅ Localhost card visible on Services page

---

## **Complete Localhost Flow**

### **1. Initial State (Not Installed):**
```
Services Page:
- Queen Card
- [No Localhost Card]  ← Hidden (TEAM-359)
- SSH Hive Cards
- Install Hive Card
  └─ Dropdown: localhost, ssh-target-1, ssh-target-2  ← Localhost available
```

### **2. User Installs Localhost:**
```
User clicks: Install Hive → Select "localhost" → Install
```

### **3. After Installation:**
```
Services Page:
- Queen Card
- Localhost Card  ← Now visible (TEAM-359)
- SSH Hive Cards
- Install Hive Card
  └─ Dropdown: ssh-target-1, ssh-target-2  ← Localhost removed (installed)
```

---

## **Integration with TEAM-359**

### **TEAM-359 (Localhost Visibility):**
- Localhost card only shows when installed
- `if (!isInstalled) return null`

### **TEAM-360 (Localhost Install):**
- Localhost in install dropdown when not installed
- Filter: `!installedHives.includes(hive.host)`

**Together:** Complete localhost lifecycle!

---

## **Files Changed**

### **Backend: tauri_commands.rs**

**Added localhost to SSH targets list:**
```rust
// TEAM-360: Add localhost as an available target
targets.insert(0, SshTarget {
    host: "localhost".to_string(),
    host_subtitle: Some("This machine".to_string()),
    hostname: "localhost".to_string(),
    user: std::env::var("USER").unwrap_or_else(|_| "user".to_string()),
    port: 22,
    status: SshTargetStatus::Unknown,
});
```

**Why:** The `ssh_list` command now includes localhost so it appears in the install dropdown.

### **Frontend: InstallHiveCard.tsx**

**Before:**
```typescript
const availableHives = hives.filter(
  (hive: SshHive) => !installedHives.includes(hive.host) && hive.host !== 'localhost'
  //                                                        ❌ Excluded
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const availableHives = hives.filter(
  (hive: SshHive) => !installedHives.includes(hive.host)
  //                 ✅ Localhost included if not installed
);
```

---

## **User Experience**

### **Before (Broken):**
1. Localhost not installed
2. Can't install from UI (not in dropdown)
3. No localhost card visible
4. **Dead end** - can't use localhost

### **After (Fixed):**
1. Localhost not installed
2. ✅ Can install from dropdown
3. After install, localhost card appears
4. ✅ Full localhost support

---

## **Summary**

✅ **Localhost in install dropdown when not installed**  
✅ **Removed from dropdown when installed**  
✅ **Works with TEAM-359 visibility logic**  
✅ **Complete localhost lifecycle support**  

**Users can now install localhost from the UI!** 🎉
