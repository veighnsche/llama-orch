# TEAM-380: Contract Alignment Fixes

**Date:** Oct 31, 2025  
**Team:** TEAM-380  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Mission

Fix all identified gaps in the contracts to ensure keeper/queen job clients align correctly with the hive job server.

## Problems Identified

1. **Response types defined but unused** - Hive returns narration events, not structured JSON
2. **HiveCheck operation missing from README** - Diagnostic operation not documented
3. **RHAI operations missing from README** - 5 RHAI script operations not documented
4. **Contract audit document stale** - Still showing operations-contract as needing fixes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Updated `operations-contract/src/responses.rs`

**Added comprehensive documentation explaining:**
- Response types are defined for type safety and documentation
- Hive currently returns narration events via SSE, not structured JSON
- Response types are for future use when structured responses are needed
- How clients currently parse narration text

**Lines added:** 20 lines of documentation at top of file

**Key message:**
```rust
//! **rbee-hive currently returns narration events via SSE, not structured JSON responses.**
//!
//! These response types are defined for:
//! 1. **Type safety** - Documenting expected response structure
//! 2. **Future use** - When structured responses are needed
//! 3. **API clients** - Programmatic access (future)
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Updated `operations-contract/README.md`

**Added missing operations:**
- ‚úÖ HiveCheck diagnostic operation
- ‚úÖ All 5 RHAI script operations (Save, Test, Get, List, Delete)
- ‚úÖ QueenCheck diagnostic operation

**Added new section: "Response Format"**
- Explains narration-based output
- Shows example SSE output
- Links to responses.rs for full documentation

**Before:**
```markdown
### Hive Operations (http://localhost:7835/v1/jobs)

**Worker process operations:**
- WorkerSpawn, WorkerProcessList, etc.

**Model operations:**
- ModelDownload, ModelList, etc.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Queen Operations (http://localhost:7833/v1/jobs)

**Orchestration operations:**
- Status, Infer

**RHAI script operations:**
- RhaiScriptSave, RhaiScriptTest, RhaiScriptGet, RhaiScriptList, RhaiScriptDelete

**Diagnostic operations:**
- QueenCheck

### Hive Operations (http://localhost:7835/v1/jobs)

**Worker process operations:**
- WorkerSpawn, WorkerProcessList, etc.

**Model operations:**
- ModelDownload, ModelList, etc.

**Diagnostic operations:**
- HiveCheck

## Response Format

**Important:** rbee-hive currently returns **narration events** via SSE...
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Updated `CONTRACT_AUDIT.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated date to Oct 31, 2025
- Changed status from "REVIEW REQUIRED" to "UPDATED"
- Updated operations-contract from ‚ö†Ô∏è to ‚úÖ
- Added TEAM-380 changes summary
- Documented all fixes applied

**Before:**
```markdown
**Status:** üîç REVIEW REQUIRED
**Findings:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 contract needs MAJOR updates (operations-contract)
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Status:** ‚úÖ UPDATED
**Findings (TEAM-380 Update):**
- ‚úÖ operations-contract - **FIXED** (was ‚ö†Ô∏è, now ‚úÖ)

**TEAM-380 Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated operations-contract README with HiveCheck, RHAI operations
- ‚úÖ Added narration-based response documentation
- ‚úÖ Clarified response types usage in responses.rs
```

## Verification

### Contract Alignment Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**What keeper/queen clients expect:**
- ‚úÖ Operation enum with all operation types
- ‚úÖ Request types for all operations
- ‚úÖ HTTP endpoints: POST /v1/jobs, GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream
- ‚úÖ SSE streaming with [DONE], [ERROR], [CANCELLED] markers
- ‚úÖ target_server() method to route operations

**What hive job server provides:**
- ‚úÖ Handles all 9 expected operations (Worker + Model + HiveCheck)
- ‚úÖ Implements POST /v1/jobs endpoint
- ‚úÖ Implements GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream SSE endpoint
- ‚úÖ Returns narration events via SSE
- ‚úÖ Sends [DONE] marker on completion
- ‚úÖ Rejects Infer operations (correct per architecture)

**Documentation status:**
- ‚úÖ All operations documented in README
- ‚úÖ Response format explained
- ‚úÖ Response types documented with usage notes
- ‚úÖ Contract audit updated

## Files Modified

1. `/home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/97_contracts/operations-contract/src/responses.rs`
   - Added 20 lines of documentation

2. `/home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/97_contracts/operations-contract/README.md`
   - Added RHAI operations section
   - Added HiveCheck to Hive operations
   - Added Response Format section
   - ~30 lines added

3. `/home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/bin/97_contracts/CONTRACT_AUDIT.md`
   - Updated status and findings
   - Documented TEAM-380 fixes
   - ~20 lines modified

## Remaining Work (Not in Scope)

The following items were identified but are NOT contract alignment issues:

1. **ssh-contract deletion** - Unused contract, can be deleted (separate cleanup task)
2. **keeper-config-contract review** - Single-use contract, needs review (separate task)
3. **Port number updates** - worker-contract and hive-contract READMEs have old port numbers (documentation only)

These are tracked in CONTRACT_AUDIT.md but don't affect keeper/queen ‚Üî hive alignment.

## Summary

All contract alignment gaps have been fixed:
- ‚úÖ Response types usage documented
- ‚úÖ All operations documented in README
- ‚úÖ Narration-based output explained
- ‚úÖ Contract audit updated

The keeper and queen job clients now have complete, accurate documentation for interacting with the hive job server.
