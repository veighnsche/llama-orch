## What Was Done

### 1. Renamed Binary Directories
- ✅ `bak.rbee-keeper` → `00_rbee_keeper`
- ✅ `bak.queen-rbee` → `10_queen_rbee`
- ✅ `bak.rbee-hive` → `20_rbee_hive`
- ✅ `bak.llm-worker-rbee` → `30_llm_worker_rbee`

### 2. Renamed Crate Directories
- ✅ `rbee-keeper-crates` → `05_rbee_keeper_crates`
- ✅ `queen-rbee-crates` → `15_queen_rbee_crates`
- ✅ `rbee-hive-crates` → `25_rbee_hive_crates`
- ✅ `worker-rbee-crates` → `39_worker_rbee_crates`
- ✅ `shared-crates` → `99_shared_crates`

### 3. Updated Cargo.toml
- ✅ Updated root `Cargo.toml` workspace members
- ✅ Updated lifecycle crate dependencies
- ✅ Updated xtask dependencies
- ✅ Updated test-harness/bdd dependencies

### 4. Verified Compilation
- ✅ `cargo check --workspace` succeeds

## Numbering Scheme

| Number | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00` | rbee-keeper binary |
| `05` | rbee-keeper crates |
| `10` | queen-rbee binary |
| `15` | queen-rbee crates |
| `20` | rbee-hive binary |
| `25` | rbee-hive crates |
| `30` | llm-worker-rbee binary |
| `39` | worker-rbee crates |
| `99` | shared crates |

---

## Benefits

### 1. Clear Hierarchy
Numbers enforce dependency order:
- Lower numbers (00-39) = Application layer
- Higher numbers (99) = Infrastructure layer

### 2. Self-Documenting
Directory names show their position in the stack immediately.

### 3. Alphabetical Sorting
Directories sort in dependency order automatically.

### 4. Room for Growth
Gaps between numbers allow for future additions.

## Old Directories (Still Present)

These are the ORIGINAL binaries (before TEAM-135 refactoring):
- `rbee-keeper.bak/` - Original keeper
- `queen-rbee.bak/` - Original queen
- `rbee-hive.bak/` - Original hive
- `llm-worker-rbee.bak/` - Original worker

**These can be deleted once the new binaries are fully implemented.**
