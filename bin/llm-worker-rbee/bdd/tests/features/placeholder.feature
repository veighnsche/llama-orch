# TEAM-135: Placeholder feature for llm-worker-rbee binary
# TODO: Replace with actual integration test features

Feature: llm-worker-rbee binary integration
  As a developer
  I want integration tests for llm-worker-rbee
  So that the binary behavior is verified

  Scenario: Binary placeholder test
    Given the llm-worker-rbee binary is available
    When I run integration tests
    Then the test harness should be ready
