# Spec Update Summary - queen-rbee Orchestration

**Date:** 2025-10-10T14:02  
**Updated By:** TEAM-037  
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## What Was Updated

All spec documents in `/bin/.specs/` have been updated to reflect the correct architecture:

### üö® CRITICAL CHANGES üö®

1. **rbee-keeper is a TESTING TOOL** - NOT for production
2. **queen-rbee orchestrates everything** - uses SSH to control hives
3. **WHENEVER queen-rbee dies, ALL hives and workers die gracefully**

## Key Architecture Changes

### OLD (INCORRECT)
```
rbee-keeper ‚Üí rbee-hive ‚Üí worker
```

### NEW (CORRECT)
```
rbee-keeper (TESTING TOOL)
    ‚Üì spawns
queen-rbee (orchestrator)
    ‚Üì SSH
rbee-hive (pool manager)
    ‚Üì spawns
llm-worker-rbee (worker)
```

## The 4 Components

| Component | Type | Production? | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| **rbee-keeper** | CLI | ‚ùå NO | **TESTING TOOL** - Integration tester |
| **queen-rbee** | HTTP Daemon | ‚úÖ YES | Orchestrator, controls hives via SSH |
| **rbee-hive** | HTTP Daemon | ‚úÖ YES | Pool manager, spawns workers |
| **llm-worker-rbee** | HTTP Daemon | ‚úÖ YES | Worker, executes inference |

---

## Critical Rules

### RULE 1: rbee-keeper is a TESTING TOOL
- **NOT for production** - use llama-orch SDK instead
- Spawns queen-rbee for testing
- Runs test, then kills everything
- Validates entire system works

### RULE 2: WHENEVER queen-rbee DIES, EVERYTHING DIES
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and **ALWAYS TRUE**
- queen-rbee death ‚Üí ALL hives die (SSH SIGTERM)
- ALL hives die ‚Üí ALL workers die (shutdown command)
- Guarantees: No orphaned processes, no leaked VRAM

### RULE 3: rbee-keeper ONLY kills queen-rbee IF it spawned it
- Ephemeral mode: rbee-keeper spawns queen-rbee ‚Üí owns lifecycle
- Persistent mode: operator starts queen-rbee ‚Üí rbee-keeper doesn't own

---

## Testing Mode Flow

```
Developer: rbee-keeper infer --node mac --model tinyllama --prompt "hello"

1. rbee-keeper spawns queen-rbee
2. queen-rbee SSH starts rbee-hive on mac
3. rbee-hive spawns worker
4. Worker ready ‚Üí rbee-hive ‚Üí queen-rbee
5. queen-rbee sends inference to worker
6. Worker streams SSE to queen-rbee
7. queen-rbee relays SSE to rbee-keeper stdout
8. Developer sees result
9. Developer Ctrl+C
10. rbee-keeper kills queen-rbee
11. queen-rbee SSH kills ALL hives
12. Hives kill ALL workers
13. Everything dies gracefully
```

---

## Production Mode Flow

```
Operator: queen-rbee daemon &
Operator: ssh mac "rbee-hive daemon &"

User App: llama-orch-sdk ‚Üí queen-rbee (HTTP POST /v2/tasks)
    ‚Üì
queen-rbee ‚Üí worker (HTTP POST /execute)
    ‚Üì
worker ‚Üí queen-rbee (SSE stream)
    ‚Üì
queen-rbee ‚Üí SDK (SSE stream)
    ‚Üì
User App gets result

# Daemons continue running
# No rbee-keeper involved
```

---

## Cascading Shutdown Guarantee

```
queen-rbee dies (SIGTERM, crash, kill, etc.)
    ‚Üì
queen-rbee's shutdown handler runs
    ‚Üì
For each rbee-hive that queen-rbee spawned:
    SSH to node
    Send SIGTERM to rbee-hive
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive receives SIGTERM
    ‚Üì
For each worker:
    HTTP POST /v1/admin/shutdown
    ‚Üì
Worker unloads model from VRAM
Worker exits cleanly
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive exits cleanly
    ‚Üì
queen-rbee exits cleanly
    ‚Üì
System completely clean
```

## Files That Still Need Updating

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] `/test-harness/bdd/tests/features/test-001.feature`
- [ ] `/test-harness/bdd/tests/features/test-001-mvp.feature`

These need to be updated to include queen-rbee in all flows.

### Other Specs (Lower Priority)
- [ ] `BINARY_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md`
- [ ] `BINARY_STRUCTURE_CLARIFICATION.md`
- [ ] `COMPLETE_BINARY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] `CONTROL_PLANE_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_NO_POOL_DAEMON.md`

These are older documents that may have outdated information.

## Summary

**What changed:**
- rbee-keeper is now clearly documented as a TESTING TOOL
- queen-rbee orchestrates everything via SSH
- Cascading shutdown is guaranteed (queen dies ‚Üí everything dies)
- Testing mode vs Production mode is clearly distinguished

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents confusion about rbee-keeper's purpose
- Ensures clean shutdown in testing (no orphaned processes)
- Clear separation between testing and production usage
- Proper lifecycle management

**Next steps:**
- Update test scenarios to include queen-rbee
- Implement queen-rbee orchestration (M1)
- Implement cascading shutdown handlers
