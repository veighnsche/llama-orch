## Critical Discoveries by TEAM-037

### Discovery 1: rbee-keeper is a Testing Tool
- **Problem**: Unclear if rbee-keeper was for production
- **Solution**: Documented that rbee-keeper is ONLY for testing/integration
- **Impact**: Production users should use llama-orch SDK → queen-rbee directly

### Discovery 2: Daemons are Persistent
- **Problem**: Unclear when rbee-hive and workers die
- **Solution**: Documented that they are persistent HTTP daemons
- **Impact**: They do NOT die after inference completes

### Discovery 3: Cascading Shutdown
- **Problem**: Unclear how shutdown propagates
- **Solution**: Documented cascading shutdown from queen-rbee → rbee-hive → workers
- **Impact**: SIGTERM to queen-rbee kills everything gracefully

### Discovery 4: Worker Idle Timeout
- **Problem**: Unclear when workers release VRAM
- **Solution**: Documented 5-minute idle timeout
- **Impact**: Workers die after 5 minutes of inactivity, freeing VRAM

## Next Steps

### For TEAM-038 (Next Implementation Team)
1. Implement BDD step definitions for test-001.feature
2. Add unit tests for GGUF support
3. Add integration tests for installation system
4. Verify lifecycle behavior matches specs

### For TEAM-039 (Next Testing Team)
1. Audit TEAM-036's work for test coverage gaps
2. Run BDD tests against implementation
3. Issue fines if violations found
4. Verify lifecycle rules are followed
