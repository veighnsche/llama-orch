## üíª Code Files

### `bin/llm-worker-rbee/src/backend/models/quantized_llama.rs` [NEW +93 lines]
**Created by:** TEAM-036  
**Purpose:** GGUF quantized model support

**What was added:**
- `QuantizedLlamaModel` struct wrapping candle's quantized_llama
- `load()` function to load GGUF files

- Extracts metadata from GGUF headers
- Wraps `candle_transformers::models::quantized_llama::ModelWeights`
- Supports Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, and other quantization formats

**Critical impact:**
- Unblocks all inference with quantized models

- Line 27: Added `QuantizedLlama(quantized_llama::QuantizedLlamaModel)` to Model enum
- Line 41: Added `Model::QuantizedLlama(m) => m.forward(input_ids, position)` to forward()
- Line 50: Added `Model::QuantizedLlama(m) => m.eos_token_id()` to eos_token_id()
- Line 58: Added `Model::QuantizedLlama(m) => m.vocab_size()` to vocab_size()
- Line 66: Added `Model::QuantizedLlama(m) => m.reset_cache()` to reset_cache()
- Line 75: Added `Model::QuantizedLlama(_) => "quantized-llama"` to architecture()
- Lines 120-125: Added GGUF detection in load_model()
- Lines 180-185: Added GGUF size calculation in calculate_model_size()

**GGUF detection logic:**
```rust
if model_path.ends_with(".gguf") {
    let model = quantized_llama::QuantizedLlamaModel::load(path, device)?;
    return Ok(Model::QuantizedLlama(model));
}
```

**Critical impact:**
