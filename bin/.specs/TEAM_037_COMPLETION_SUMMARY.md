# TEAM-037 Completion Summary: BDD Test Suite for TEST-001

**Team:** TEAM-037 (Testing Team)  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Mission

Create comprehensive Gherkin BDD test specifications for TEST-001 cross-node inference flow with **critical lifecycle clarifications**.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Complete BDD Test Suite ✅

**Location:** `/test-harness/bdd/tests/features/`

| File | Scenarios | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `test-001.feature` | 67 | Complete test suite covering all TEST-001 behaviors |
| `test-001-mvp.feature` | 27 | MVP subset with critical path and essential edge cases |

### 2. Lifecycle Clarification ✅

**Critical Discovery:** rbee-hive and llm-worker-rbee are **PERSISTENT HTTP DAEMONS**, not ephemeral processes.

**Key Rules Documented:**
- RULE 1: rbee-hive is a persistent HTTP daemon (dies only on SIGTERM)
- RULE 2: llm-worker-rbee is a persistent HTTP daemon (dies on idle timeout or shutdown)
- RULE 3: rbee-keeper is ephemeral CLI (dies after command completes)
- RULE 4: Ephemeral mode (rbee-keeper spawns rbee-hive)
- RULE 5: Persistent mode (rbee-hive pre-started)
- RULE 6: Cascading shutdown
- RULE 7: Worker idle timeout
- RULE 8: Process ownership

### 3. Documentation ✅

**Created:**
- `/test-harness/bdd/README.md` - BDD test harness overview
- `/test-harness/bdd/LIFECYCLE_CLARIFICATION.md` - Normative lifecycle rules
- `/test-harness/bdd/TEAM_037_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Critical Lifecycle Scenarios

### NEW: MVP-008 through MVP-013

These scenarios **clarify the most critical misunderstanding** in the original spec:

**MVP-008:** rbee-hive is a persistent HTTP daemon
```gherkin
Then rbee-hive does NOT exit
And rbee-hive continues monitoring worker health every 30 seconds
And rbee-hive HTTP API remains accessible
```

**MVP-009:** Worker idle timeout (worker dies, pool lives)
```gherkin
Then worker exits cleanly at T+5:02
And rbee-hive continues running as daemon (does NOT exit)
```

**MVP-010:** rbee-keeper exits after inference (CLI dies, daemons live)
```gherkin
Then rbee-keeper exits with code 0
And rbee-hive continues running as daemon
And worker continues running as daemon
```

**MVP-011:** Cascading shutdown when rbee-hive receives SIGTERM
```gherkin
When user sends SIGTERM to rbee-hive (Ctrl+C)
Then rbee-hive sends "POST /v1/admin/shutdown" to all 3 workers
And all workers unload models and exit
And rbee-hive exits cleanly
```

**MVP-012:** Ephemeral mode (rbee-keeper spawns rbee-hive)
```gherkin
Then rbee-keeper spawns rbee-hive as child process
And rbee-keeper sends SIGTERM to rbee-hive
And rbee-hive cascades shutdown to worker
And all processes exit
```

**MVP-013:** Persistent mode (rbee-hive pre-started)
```gherkin
Then rbee-keeper connects to existing rbee-hive HTTP API
And rbee-keeper does NOT spawn rbee-hive
And rbee-hive continues running (was not spawned by rbee-keeper)
```

## Architecture Alignment

### Verified Against Specs

✅ **FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_SSH_CONTROL_HTTP_INFERENCE.md**
- rbee-hive is HTTP daemon on port 8080
- llm-worker-rbee is HTTP daemon on port 8001+
- rbee-keeper is CLI that calls HTTP APIs

✅ **ARCHITECTURE_MODES.md**
- Ephemeral mode: rbee-keeper spawns rbee-hive
- Persistent mode: rbee-hive pre-started
- Cascading shutdown on SIGTERM

✅ **COMPONENT_RESPONSIBILITIES_FINAL.md**
- rbee-hive monitors worker health every 30s
- rbee-hive enforces idle timeout (5 min)
- Worker registry is in-memory (ephemeral)
- Model catalog is SQLite (persistent)

✅ **test-001-mvp.md**
- All phases (1-8) covered
- All edge cases (EC1-EC10) covered
- Pool manager lifecycle clarified

---

## BDD Best Practices Applied

### ✅ Traceability
- Headers link to TEST-001 specification
- TEAM-030 architecture notes included
- Component ownership documented

### ✅ Given-When-Then Structure
```gherkin
Given <precondition>
When <action>
Then <expected outcome>
And <additional assertion>
```

### ✅ Data Tables
```gherkin
Given a worker is registered with:
  | field      | value           |
  | id         | worker-abc123   |
  | state      | idle            |
```

### ✅ Multi-line Strings
```gherkin
When I run:
  """
  rbee-keeper infer \
    --node mac \
    --prompt "hello"
  """
```

### ✅ Tags for Filtering
- `@mvp` - MVP scenarios
- `@critical` - Critical path
- `@edge-case` - Edge case handling
- `@lifecycle` - Process lifecycle
- `@happy-path` - Happy path flows

### ✅ Lifecycle Documentation
- 8 lifecycle rules documented in feature files
- Lifecycle clarification document created
- Common mistakes documented

---

## What Changed from Original Spec

### Original Assumption (WRONG)
```
rbee-hive spawns worker → worker ready → rbee-hive exits
```

### Correct Understanding (RIGHT)
```
rbee-hive spawns worker → worker ready → rbee-hive continues running
rbee-hive monitors worker health every 30s
rbee-hive enforces idle timeout (5 min)
rbee-hive only exits on SIGTERM
```

### Impact
- **6 new lifecycle scenarios** (MVP-008 through MVP-013)
- **Lifecycle rules** documented in feature files
- **Process ownership** clarified
- **Ephemeral vs Persistent modes** distinguished

## Implementation Guidance

### For Step Definition Authors

When implementing step definitions for these scenarios:

1. **Read LIFECYCLE_CLARIFICATION.md first**
   - Understand when processes start/stop
   - Understand process ownership rules

2. **Follow BDD_RUST_MOCK_LESSONS_LEARNED.md**
   - Use environment variables for test mode detection
   - Implement mock reset functions
   - Explicitly drop before reassigning

3. **Follow BDD_WIRING.md**
   - World struct holds scenario state
   - Steps are organized by domain
   - Use cucumber macros correctly

4. **Test lifecycle scenarios carefully**
   - MVP-008 through MVP-013 are critical
   - Verify processes don't exit unexpectedly
   - Verify cascading shutdown works

### For Implementers

When implementing the actual system:

1. **rbee-keeper (CLI)**
   - Detect if rbee-hive is already running
   - If not running, spawn rbee-hive as child
   - If spawned, send SIGTERM on exit
   - If not spawned, do NOT send SIGTERM

2. **rbee-hive (HTTP Daemon)**
   - Start HTTP server on port 8080
   - Monitor worker health every 30s
   - Enforce idle timeout (5 min)
   - Cascading shutdown on SIGTERM
   - Persist model catalog on shutdown

3. **llm-worker-rbee (HTTP Daemon)**
   - Start HTTP server on port 8001+
   - Load model into VRAM
   - Send ready callback to rbee-hive
   - Respond to shutdown command
   - Unload model on shutdown
