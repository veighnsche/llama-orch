## rbee CLI Commands

**Binary:** `rbee`  
**Purpose:** CLI tool for managing queen-rbee, hives, workers, and inference

### Queen Management

```bash
# Start queen-rbee daemon
rbee queen start

# Stop queen-rbee daemon
rbee queen stop
```

### Hive Management

```bash
# Start rbee-hive on localhost
rbee hive start

## queen-rbee HTTP Endpoints

**Binary:** `queen-rbee`  
**Default Port:** 8500  
**Purpose:** Orchestrates hives, schedules jobs, receives heartbeats

### Health

```
GET /health
```

**Purpose:** Health check endpoint  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

**Used by:** rbee-keeper to check if queen is running

---

### Shutdown

```
POST /shutdown
```

**Purpose:** Graceful shutdown of queen-rbee  
**Response:** `200 OK`

**Note:** Shuts down the HTTP server and exits

---

### Hive Start

```
POST /hive/start
```

**Purpose:** Start a hive (spawn hive process)  
**Request:** None (uses default localhost:8600)  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "hive_url": "http://localhost:8600",
  "hive_id": "localhost",
  "port": 8600
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Queen decides where to spawn (localhost for now)
2. Queen adds hive to catalog (status: Unknown)
3. Queen spawns hive process (fire and forget)
4. Hive sends heartbeat when ready (callback mechanism)

**Note:** Does NOT wait for hive to be ready!

---

### Heartbeat (Hive â†’ Queen)

```
POST /heartbeat
```

**Purpose:** Receive heartbeat from hive  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "hive_id": "localhost",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T19:00:00Z",
  "workers": [
    {
      "worker_id": "worker-123",
      "state": "Idle",
      "model": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Heartbeat received from localhost"
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Hive sends heartbeat (callback when ready)
2. Queen checks if first heartbeat
3. If first â†’ trigger device detection
4. Update catalog with timestamp
5. Return acknowledgement

**Note:** This is the callback mechanism - hive signals it's ready!

---

### Job Create

```
POST /jobs
```

**Purpose:** Create a new inference job  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "model": "HF:author/model",

}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "job-uuid",
  "sse_url": "/jobs/job-uuid/stream"
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Create job in registry
2. Check hive availability
3. Return job_id + SSE URL for streaming

---

### Job Stream

```

## Architecture Summary

### Request Flow

```
User
  â†“
rbee CLI
  â†“
queen-rbee (8500)
  â†“
rbee-hive (8600)
  â†“
llm-worker-rbee (dynamic port)
```

### Heartbeat Flow

```
llm-worker-rbee
  â†“ (every 30s)
POST /v1/heartbeat
  â†“
rbee-hive
  â†“ (every 15s, aggregated)
POST /heartbeat
  â†“
queen-rbee
```

### Callback Mechanism

```
queen-rbee: POST /hive/start
  â†“ (spawn process, return immediately)
rbee-hive: starts up
  â†“ (when ready)
rbee-hive: POST /heartbeat â†’ queen-rbee
  â†“
queen-rbee: triggers device detection
  â†“
queen-rbee: GET /v1/devices â†’ rbee-hive
  â†“
queen-rbee: updates catalog (hive is Online)
```

**Key Point:** Queen doesn't wait - heartbeat is the callback!

## Port Summary

| Binary | Default Port | Configurable |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| queen-rbee | 8500 | Yes (--port) |
| rbee-hive | 8600 | Yes (--port) |

---

## Authentication

- **queen-rbee:** No auth (local only)
- **rbee-hive:** Optional JWT auth (network mode)
- **llm-worker-rbee:** No auth (hive-only)
