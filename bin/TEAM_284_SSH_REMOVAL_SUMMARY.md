# TEAM-284: SSH and Remote Operations Removal

**Date:** Oct 24, 2025  
**Mission:** Remove all SSH functionality, remote installation, and daemon-sync operations from rbee

## Summary

Successfully removed all SSH and remote operations from the codebase. **rbee is now localhost-only.**

## What Was Removed

### 1. **Package Operations** (6 operations)
- ❌ `PackageSync` - Sync all hives to match config
- ❌ `PackageStatus` - Check package status and detect drift
- ❌ `PackageInstall` - Install all components
- ❌ `PackageUninstall` - Uninstall components
- ❌ `PackageValidate` - Validate declarative config
- ❌ `PackageMigrate` - Generate config from current state

### 2. **Crates Deleted**
- ❌ `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-sync/` - SSH-based remote synchronization
- ❌ `bin/99_shared_crates/ssh-client/` - SSH client wrapper
- ❌ `bin/99_shared_crates/ssh-client/bdd/` - SSH client tests

### 3. **Handler Files Deleted**
- ❌ `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/sync.rs`
- ❌ `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/package_status.rs`
- ❌ `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/validate.rs`
- ❌ `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/migrate.rs`

### 4. **Test Files Deleted**
- ❌ `xtask/tests/daemon_sync_integration.rs`

### 5. **Module Deletions**
- ❌ `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/ssh_helper.rs`

## Files Modified

### Contract Layer
- **`bin/99_shared_crates/rbee-operations/src/lib.rs`**
  - Removed 6 Package operation variants from `Operation` enum
  - Removed Package operation cases from `Operation::name()`
  - Added TEAM-284 deletion markers

### Router Layer
- **`bin/10_queen_rbee/src/job_router.rs`**
  - Removed daemon_sync import
  - Removed HivesConfig import
  - Removed all Package operation handlers (~110 LOC)
  - Added TEAM-284 deletion markers

### CLI Layer
- **`bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/cli/commands.rs`**
  - Removed 4 Package command variants (Sync, PackageStatus, Validate, Migrate)
  - Added TEAM-284 deletion markers

- **`bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/mod.rs`**
  - Removed 4 handler module imports
  - Removed 4 handler function exports

- **`bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/main.rs`**
  - Removed 4 handler imports
  - Removed 4 command routing match arms

### Lifecycle Layer
- **`bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/lib.rs`**
  - Removed `pub mod ssh_helper;` declaration

- **`bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/start.rs`**
  - Removed ssh_helper imports
  - Removed remote hive detection logic
  - Removed SSH-based remote start (~35 LOC)
  - Kept only local DaemonManager-based start

- **`bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/stop.rs`**
  - Removed ssh_helper imports
  - Removed remote hive detection logic
  - Removed SSH-based remote stop (~25 LOC)
  - Kept only local pkill-based stop

### Dependency Management
- **`Cargo.toml`** (workspace root)
  - Removed `bin/99_shared_crates/daemon-sync` from members
  - Removed `bin/99_shared_crates/ssh-client` from members
  - Removed `bin/99_shared_crates/ssh-client/bdd` from members

- **`bin/10_queen_rbee/Cargo.toml`**
  - Removed `daemon-sync` dependency

- **`bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/Cargo.toml`**
  - Removed `queen-rbee-ssh-client` dependency

### Documentation
- **`bin/ADDING_NEW_OPERATIONS.md`**
  - Added TEAM-284 removal notice at top
  - Updated operation history section
  - Documented that rbee is now localhost-only

## Verification

All three main packages compile successfully:

```bash
✅ cargo check -p rbee-operations
✅ cargo check -p queen-rbee-hive-lifecycle
✅ cargo check -p queen-rbee
✅ cargo check -p rbee-keeper
```

## Impact

### What Still Works
- ✅ All localhost operations (HiveStart, HiveStop, HiveList, HiveGet, HiveStatus)
- ✅ Worker lifecycle management (local)
- ✅ Model management (local)
- ✅ Inference operations (local)
- ✅ Status command (live registry view)

### What No Longer Works
- ❌ Remote hive management via SSH
- ❌ Remote installation/uninstallation
- ❌ Declarative config-driven synchronization
- ❌ Drift detection across multiple hives

### Architecture Change
**Before:** Queen could manage remote hives via SSH  
**After:** Queen manages only localhost hives via direct process spawning

## Code Statistics

**Lines Removed:** ~800+ LOC
- Package operations in job_router.rs: ~110 LOC
- daemon-sync crate: ~400 LOC
- ssh-client crate: ~150 LOC
- Handler files: ~100 LOC
- Remote logic in start.rs/stop.rs: ~60 LOC

**Files Deleted:** 9 files
- 2 crate directories (daemon-sync, ssh-client)
- 4 handler files
- 1 test file
- 1 ssh_helper module
- 1 BDD directory

## Migration Path (If Remote Support Needed Later)

If remote operations are needed in the future:

1. **Option 1: Pure Rust SSH** - Implement using `russh` library (see archived `bin/.plan/RUSSH_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
2. **Option 2: Agent-Based** - Deploy rbee-hive as a service on remote machines, manage via HTTP API
3. **Option 3: Kubernetes** - Use k8s for orchestration instead of SSH

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (Agent-Based) is most aligned with modern distributed systems architecture.

## Conclusion

✅ **All SSH and remote operations successfully removed**  
✅ **Codebase compiles cleanly**  
✅ **Documentation updated**  
✅ **rbee is now localhost-only**

The system is now simpler, more maintainable, and focused on local operations. Remote management can be re-added in the future using a more modern architecture (HTTP-based agents) if needed.
