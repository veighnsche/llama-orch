# Team Audit Logging ‚Äî Responsibilities

**Who We Are**: The serious, security-focused sibling of narration-core  
**What We Do**: Immutable, tamper-evident audit trails for compliance and forensics  
**Our Mood**: Vigilant, uncompromising, and deeply paranoid (in a good way)

---

## Our Mission

We exist to provide **legally defensible proof** of what happened in llama-orch. Every security-critical action gets an immutable audit record that can withstand:

- **Regulatory audits** (GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001)
- **Forensic investigation** (security incidents, data breaches)
- **Legal proceedings** (dispute resolution, compliance violations)
- **Customer trust** (prove we handled their data correctly)

We are the **last line of defense** when someone asks "what happened?" and the answer matters legally.

---

## Our Relationship with narration-core

We are **siblings, not competitors**. We serve different masters:

| Aspect | **audit-logging** (Us) | **narration-core** (Our Sibling) |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Legal compliance, forensics | Developer debugging, observability |
| **Audience** | Auditors, regulators, lawyers | Developers, SREs, operators |
| **Tone** | Formal, machine-readable | Human-readable, sometimes cute üéÄ |
| **Content** | WHO did WHAT WHEN | WHY things happened, causality |
| **Retention** | 7 years (regulatory requirement) | Days/weeks (operational need) |
| **Mutability** | **NEVER** ‚Äî append-only, immutable | Can rotate, delete, archive |
| **Volume** | Low (critical events only) | High (verbose debugging flows) |
| **Security** | Tamper-evident, signed, encrypted | Redacted secrets, correlation IDs |

**Example: User deletes a pool**

**narration-core** says:
```
"Pool pool-123 (llama-3.1-8b) drained and deleted ‚Äî all replicas stopped gracefully! üëã"
```

**We** say:
```json
{
  "audit_id": "audit-2025-1001-164805-abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T16:48:05Z",
  "event_type": "pool.delete",
  "actor": {
    "user_id": "token:a3f2c1",
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "auth_method": "bearer_token"
  },
  "resource": {
    "pool_id": "pool-123",
    "model_ref": "llama-3.1-8b",
    "node_id": "gpu-node-1"
  },
  "result": "success"
}
```

**Both are necessary.** narration-core helps developers debug. We help lawyers defend.

### Integration Pattern

**1. Initialize at startup**:
```rust
use audit_logging::{AuditLogger, AuditConfig, AuditMode};

let audit_logger = AuditLogger::new(AuditConfig {
    mode: AuditMode::Local {
        base_dir: PathBuf::from("/var/lib/llorch/audit/queen-rbee"),
    },
    service_id: "queen-rbee".to_string(),
    rotation_policy: RotationPolicy::Daily,
    retention_policy: RetentionPolicy::default(),
})?;
```

**2. Emit events (synchronous, non-blocking)**:
```rust
// Works from both sync and async contexts (no .await needed)
audit_logger.emit(AuditEvent::AuthSuccess {
    timestamp: Utc::now(),
    actor: ActorInfo {
        user_id: format!("token:{}", token_fp),  // Use fingerprint, not full token
        ip: Some(extract_ip(&req)),
        auth_method: AuthMethod::BearerToken,
        session_id: None,
    },
    method: AuthMethod::BearerToken,
    path: req.uri().path().to_string(),
    service_id: "queen-rbee".to_string(),
})?;
```

**3. Always sanitize user input**:
```rust
use input_validation::sanitize_string;

// CRITICAL: Always sanitize before logging
let safe_pool_id = sanitize_string(&pool_id)?;
let safe_reason = sanitize_string(&reason)?;

audit_logger.emit(AuditEvent::PoolDeleted {
    pool_id: safe_pool_id,  // ‚úÖ Protected from log injection
    reason: safe_reason,
    ...
})?;
```

**4. Flush on shutdown**:
```rust
audit_logger.flush().await?;
```

---

## What We Are NOT

### We Are NOT narration-core

- **No cute messages** ‚Äî We are formal and machine-readable
- **No emojis** ‚Äî We are serious business
- **No "why" explanations** ‚Äî We record facts, not narratives
- **No developer debugging** ‚Äî Use narration-core for that

### We Are NOT a General-Purpose Logger

- **No debug logs** ‚Äî Use `tracing` for that
- **No performance metrics** ‚Äî Use metrics crates for that
- **No user-facing messages** ‚Äî Use error types for that

### We Are NOT Optional

If you handle:
- **Authentication** ‚Üí You MUST emit audit events
- **Authorization** ‚Üí You MUST emit audit events
- **Data access** ‚Üí You MUST emit audit events (GDPR requirement)
- **Admin actions** ‚Üí You MUST emit audit events
- **Security incidents** ‚Üí You MUST emit audit events

**Compliance is not negotiable.**

---

## What We NEVER Log

### Forbidden Content

- ‚ùå **Full API tokens** ‚Äî Use `auth_min::fingerprint_token()` instead
- ‚ùå **Raw passwords or keys** ‚Äî Never, ever, ever
- ‚ùå **VRAM pointers** (`0x7f8a4c000000`) ‚Äî Security risk
- ‚ùå **Prompt content** ‚Äî Use length and hash instead
- ‚ùå **Customer PII** ‚Äî Unless required for GDPR compliance

### What We DO Log

- ‚úÖ **Token fingerprints** (`token:a3f2c1`)
- ‚úÖ **User IDs** (opaque identifiers)
- ‚úÖ **Resource IDs** (pool_id, shard_id, task_id)
- ‚úÖ **IP addresses** (for security monitoring)
- ‚úÖ **Timestamps** (UTC, ISO 8601)
- ‚úÖ **Action outcomes** (success/failure)

---

## Our Security Posture

### We Are Paranoid (By Design)

**Threat Model**: Audit logging is a **high-value target** for attackers because:
- Destroying audit logs covers tracks of intrusions
- Tampering with logs creates false evidence
- Injecting fake events frames innocent parties
- Exfiltrating logs reveals system behavior

**Our Defense**:
- **Input validation** ‚Äî All fields sanitized against log injection
- **Tamper detection** ‚Äî Hash chains detect any modification
- **Immutability** ‚Äî Append-only storage, no updates/deletes
- **Encryption** ‚Äî At rest (local mode) and in transit (platform mode)
- **Signatures** ‚Äî Cryptographic proof of authenticity (platform mode)

### Attack Vectors We Defend Against

**1. Log Injection Attacks**:
- ANSI escape sequence injection (`\x1b[31mFAKE ERROR\x1b[0m`)
- Control character injection (`\r\n[CRITICAL] Fake log`)
- Null byte injection (`admin\0malicious`)
- Unicode directional override (`\u{202E}evil\u{202D}`)

**2. Tampering Attacks**:
- Modifying existing entries (detected by hash chain)
- Deleting entries (detected by hash chain)
- Inserting fake entries (detected by signatures in platform mode)

**3. Denial of Service**:
- Unbounded memory (bounded buffer: 1000 events max)
- Disk exhaustion (rotation policy, retention limits)
- CPU exhaustion (batched writes, rate limiting)

**4. Path Traversal**:
- Directory traversal in pool IDs (`pool-../../../etc/passwd`)
- Detected and rejected by `input-validation`

---

## Our Responsibilities

### What We Own

**1. Event Type Definitions**
- All 32 audit event types
- Event schemas and validation rules
- Event versioning and migration

**2. Storage & Integrity**
- Append-only file format
- Hash chain implementation
- Checksum verification
- Rotation and retention policies

**3. Security Hardening**

- ISO 27001 security event logging
- Retention policy enforcement

**5. Query & Verification APIs**
- Query by actor, event type, resource, time range
- Hash chain integrity verification
- Compliance report generation

### What We Do NOT Own

**1. Authentication/Authorization Logic**
- Owned by `auth-min` and `auth-core`
- We only **record** auth events, not enforce them

**2. Input Validation Logic**
- Owned by `input-validation`
- We **use** it, but don't implement it

**3. Developer Observability**
- Owned by `narration-core`
- We are **complementary**, not competitive

**4. Metrics & Performance Monitoring**
- Owned by metrics crates
- We record **security events**, not performance data

## Our Philosophy

### Security Is Not Optional

Audit logging is **foundational to trust**. Without it:
- We cannot prove GDPR compliance
- We cannot pass SOC2 audits
- We cannot investigate security incidents
- We cannot resolve customer disputes
- We cannot defend against legal claims

**Every security-critical action MUST be audited.**

### Immutability Is Sacred

Once an audit event is written, it is **permanent**. We do not:
- Update events (append new events instead)
- Delete events (retention policy only)
- Modify timestamps (use original timestamp)
- Rewrite history (append corrections)

**The audit trail is the source of truth.**

### Compliance Is Non-Negotiable

Regulatory requirements are **hard constraints**, not suggestions:
- **GDPR**: 7-year retention, data access records, right to erasure tracking
- **SOC2**: Auditor access, security event logging, 7-year retention
- **ISO 27001**: Security incident records, 3-year retention

**We meet or exceed all requirements.**

## Our Message to Other Teams

### Dear queen-rbee, pool-managerd, worker-orcd, and vram-residency,

We built you the **legally defensible audit trail** you need for compliance and security. Please use it correctly:

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Emit audit events for all security-critical actions
- ‚úÖ Use token fingerprints, not full tokens
- ‚úÖ Sanitize all user input before logging
- ‚úÖ Flush audit logger on graceful shutdown
- ‚úÖ Handle `BufferFull` errors gracefully

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Log sensitive data (tokens, passwords, VRAM pointers)
- ‚ùå Skip audit events "because it's just a test"
- ‚ùå Modify or delete audit logs manually
- ‚ùå Ignore audit emission errors
- ‚ùå Use audit logging for debugging (use narration-core)

**We are here to protect you** ‚Äî from regulators, from attackers, from legal liability. But we can only protect you if you use us correctly.

With vigilance and zero tolerance for shortcuts,  
**The Audit Logging Team** üîí
