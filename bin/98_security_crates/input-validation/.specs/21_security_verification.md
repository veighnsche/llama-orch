## 5. Known Limitations & Mitigations

### 5.1 TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) ⚠️ DOCUMENTED

**Limitation**: Path validation cannot prevent race conditions between validation and use.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Documented in code comments
- ✅ Documented in 20_security.md section 9.1
- ✅ Caller responsibility to handle atomicity
- ✅ Recommendation: Use `File::open()` immediately after validation

**Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTED LIMITATION (caller responsibility)

---

### 5.2 Unicode Normalization ⚠️ DEFERRED

**Limitation**: No Unicode normalization (NFC vs NFD) in M0.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ ASCII-only policy for identifiers (prevents issue)
- ✅ Documented in 20_security.md section 9.2
- ✅ Prompts allow Unicode (intentional)
- ✅ Post-M0 enhancement planned

**Status**: ⚠️ DEFERRED TO POST-M0 (mitigated by ASCII-only policy)

---

### 5.3 Unicode Directional Override ⚠️ DEFERRED

**Limitation**: No detection of Unicode directional override characters (U+202E).

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ ASCII-only policy for identifiers (prevents issue)
- ✅ Sanitize function blocks control characters
- ✅ Post-M0 enhancement planned

**Status**: ⚠️ DEFERRED TO POST-M0 (mitigated by ASCII-only policy)

---

### 5.4 Symlink Resolution ⚠️ INTEGRATION TEST REQUIRED

**Limitation**: Symlink attack prevention requires filesystem access (not unit testable).

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Path canonicalization implemented
- ✅ Containment check implemented
- ✅ String-based traversal checks unit tested
- ⚠️ Full symlink resolution requires integration test

**Status**: ⚠️ INTEGRATION TEST REQUIRED (implementation complete)
