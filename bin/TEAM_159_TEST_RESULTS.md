# TEAM-159: BDD Test Results

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** Tests run, issues identified

## Test Results Summary

### device-detection crate: 25/25 PASSING
- CPU core detection works
- System RAM detection works (fixed bytes conversion)
- GPU detection works
- Backend detection works

### queen-rbee BDD: 4 passing, 2 failing, 9 skipped

**Passing:**
- Subsequent heartbeats do not trigger device detection
- Heartbeat updates last_heartbeat timestamp  
- No hives found on clean install
- Hive catalog is initialized

**Failing:**
1. First heartbeat triggers device detection - needs HTTP mocking
2. Heartbeat from unknown hive - test setup issue

**Skipped:**
- happy_flow_part1.feature (9 scenarios) - missing step definitions

## Issues

1. HTTP mocking needed for device detection integration test
2. happy_flow_part1.feature needs implementation or removal
3. Some test setup issues in heartbeat_steps.rs

## What Works

- Device detection crate: all tests pass
- System detection: CPU and RAM work correctly
- Basic CRUD: hive catalog operations work
- Heartbeat updates: timestamp tracking works

## Recommendation

Keep passing tests, fix or remove failing ones, delete or implement happy_flow_part1.feature.
