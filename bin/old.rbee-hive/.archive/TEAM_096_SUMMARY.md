# TEAM-096 Work Summary

**Mission:** Fix port allocation conflicts and implement fail-fast protocol in rbee-hive

**Status:** üü° TESTING - Code complete, awaiting end-to-end verification

## What We Fixed

### 1. Port Allocation Bug (Root Cause of "Address already in use")

**Problem:** Port calculation was `8081 + worker_count`, which reused ports from dead workers still in registry.

**Solution:** Smart port allocation that:
- Extracts actual ports from all registered workers
- Finds first unused port starting from 8081
- Fails gracefully if ports 8081-9000 exhausted
- Logs allocation decisions for debugging

**File:** `bin/rbee-hive/src/http/workers.rs` lines 144-167

### 2. Fail-Fast Protocol (Stops infinite 404 loops)

**Problem:** Failed workers logged errors forever but never removed from registry.

**Solution:** Fail-fast protocol that:
- Tracks failed health checks per worker
- Resets counter on successful check
- Removes worker after 3 consecutive failures (~90s)
- Applies to both HTTP errors and connection failures

**Files:**
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/registry.rs` - Added `failed_health_checks` field and methods
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/monitor.rs` - Implemented removal logic

### 3. Enhanced Narration (Better debugging visibility)

**Added logs:**
- `üîç Port allocation: N workers registered, using port P`
- `üîç Health monitor: Checking N workers`
- `üö® FAIL-FAST: Removing worker after 3 failed health checks`
- `failed_checks = N` in error logs

## Verification

### Compilation & Tests

```bash
cargo check -p rbee-hive  # ‚úÖ SUCCESS
cargo test -p rbee-hive   # ‚úÖ 42/43 passed (1 pre-existing failure unrelated)
```

**All registry and monitor tests pass.**

### End-to-End Testing Needed

The user should verify:

1. **Port reuse works:**
   ```bash
   # Start rbee-hive
   # Spawn worker 1 (gets port 8081)
   # Kill worker 1
   # Wait 90s for fail-fast removal
   # Spawn worker 2 (should get port 8081, not 8082)
   ```

2. **Fail-fast removes dead workers:**
   ```bash
   # Start rbee-hive
   # Spawn worker, then kill it
   # Watch logs - should see 3 health check failures
   # After 90s, worker should be removed from registry
   ```

3. **Port exhaustion handled gracefully:**
   ```bash
   # Try spawning 920 workers (8081-9000)
   # 921st worker should fail with clear error message
   ```

## Code Quality

- ‚úÖ All changes have TEAM-096 signatures
- ‚úÖ No TODO markers left behind
- ‚úÖ Follows engineering rules (no masturbatory victory claims)
- ‚úÖ One investigation document (this + detailed investigation doc)
- ‚úÖ Status clearly marked as üü° TESTING

## What We Did NOT Fix

- **Question mark bug** - That's a separate issue (TEAM-095)
- **Provisioner catalog test failure** - Pre-existing, unrelated
- **TokenOutputStream buffering** - Different issue, separate investigation needed

## Next Team Should

1. Run end-to-end tests listed above
2. If tests pass: Update status to üü¢ VERIFIED FIXED
3. If tests fail: Update status to üî¥ NOT FIXED, investigate further
4. Continue with question mark bug investigation (TEAM-095's work)
