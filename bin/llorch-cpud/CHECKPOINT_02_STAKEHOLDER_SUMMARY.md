# Checkpoint 2: QKV Projection - Stakeholder Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MATHEMATICALLY VALIDATED (NOT MODEL-VALIDATED)**  
**Team:** CASCADE üåä  
**‚ùå CRITICAL: NOT TESTED WITH REAL GPT-2 WEIGHTS**

---

## Bottom Line

**‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint 2 (QKV Projection) is MATHEMATICALLY VALIDATED but NOT MODEL-VALIDATED.**

**‚úÖ What Works:** Mathematical correctness validated with synthetic weights (65x better than tolerance)  
**‚ùå What's Missing:** Real GPT-2 model weights, HuggingFace comparison, end-to-end validation

---

## What Was Delivered

### Implementation
‚úÖ QKV Projection layer (`src/layers/attention/qkv.rs`)
- Linear projection: `[batch, seq, dim]` ‚Üí `[batch, seq, 3*dim]`
- Reshape and split into Query, Key, Value tensors
- Each output: `[batch, seq, n_heads, head_dim]`

### Validation
‚ö†Ô∏è **3 validation approaches (synthetic weights only):**
1. **Determinism Test:** Bit-exact across runs ‚úÖ
2. **Candle Test Harness:** Synthetic weight matching (NOT real Candle model) ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **Mistral.rs Test Harness:** Synthetic weight matching (NOT real Mistral.rs model) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**‚ùå MISSING:** Validation with real GPT-2 weights and HuggingFace transformers

### Proof Bundle
‚úÖ **Complete test artifacts:**
- Implementation tests
- Reference implementations
- Output files (9 files with tensor data)
- Comparison scripts
- Automated validation suite

## Validation Results

| Metric | Result | Requirement | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Q Tensor Max Diff | 6.5e-06 | < 1e-4 | ‚úÖ 65x better |
| K Tensor Max Diff | 4.6e-06 | < 1e-4 | ‚úÖ 87x better |
| V Tensor Max Diff | 6.2e-06 | < 1e-4 | ‚úÖ 64x better |
| Determinism | Bit-exact | Bit-exact | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| Test Coverage | 2/2 passing | All passing | ‚úÖ 100% |

---

## Critical Fix Applied

**Issue:** Initial implementation had incorrect weight layout causing 100%+ errors

**Root Cause:** Candle's Linear layer uses `[out_features, in_features]` format with internal transpose

**Solution:** Updated weight generation to match Candle's layout with proper transpose handling

**Result:** Perfect alignment with references (6.5e-06 max difference)

# Expected: 2/2 tests passing
```

## Risk Assessment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Mitigated Risks
- **Mathematical Correctness:** Validated with synthetic weights ‚úÖ
- **Determinism:** Bit-exact reproducibility confirmed ‚úÖ
- **Compatibility:** Matches test harness weight format (NOT verified with real models) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Testing:** Automated validation suite for synthetic weights only ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üî¥ UNMITIGATED RISKS
- **Model Correctness:** NOT validated with real GPT-2 weights ‚ùå
- **Production Readiness:** Cannot confirm works with actual models ‚ùå
- **Weight Transpose:** Unverified with real Conv1D weights ‚ùå

### ‚ùå CRITICAL LIMITATIONS
- **NO real GPT-2 model weights tested**
- **NO HuggingFace transformers comparison**
- **Reference implementations are test harnesses, not actual models**
- **Conv1D transpose handling unverified with real weights**
- Limited to GPT-2 Medium configuration (1024 dim, 16 heads)
- CPU-only validation (no GPU testing yet)

### üî¥ REQUIRED Before Production
1. **Load real GPT-2 Medium weights** from HuggingFace/safetensors
2. **Test with actual tokenized inputs** ("Hello." ‚Üí [15496, 13])
3. **Compare with HuggingFace transformers** output
4. **Validate Conv1D transpose** with real model weights
5. **End-to-end inference validation**
6. Test other model sizes
7. GPU implementation and validation

## Comparison to Checkpoint 1

| Aspect | Checkpoint 1 (LayerNorm) | Checkpoint 2 (QKV) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Max Difference | 6.6e-06 | 6.5e-06 |
| Tolerance | 1e-4 | 1e-4 |
| References | Candle + Mistral.rs | Candle + Mistral.rs |
| Critical Issue | None | Weight transpose |
| Resolution Time | - | Same session |
| Test Coverage | 100% | 100% |

**Consistency:** Both checkpoints achieve similar precision levels, demonstrating reliable validation methodology.
