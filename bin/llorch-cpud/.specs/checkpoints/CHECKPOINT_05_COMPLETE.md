## Implementation Details

### File Created/Modified by TEAM-001

1. **`src/layers/attention/output.rs`** - Complete implementation
   - Softmax application to attention scores
   - Transpose V to match PyTorch convention
   - Weighted sum computation (attention @ V)
   - Transpose back and merge heads
   - Output projection with c_proj weights

2. **`tests/real_gpt2_checkpoint_05.rs`** - Validation tests
   - Real GPT-2 ground truth comparison
   - Determinism validation
   - Comprehensive venv documentation

### Key Implementation Steps

```rust
// TEAM-001: Complete attention mechanism
pub fn forward(&self, attn_scores: &Array3<f32>, v: &Array3<f32>) -> Array2<f32> {
    // 1. Apply softmax to attention scores
    let attn_weights = softmax_3d(attn_scores);
    
    // 2. Transpose V from [seq, n_heads, head_dim] to [n_heads, seq, head_dim]
    let v_t = transpose_v(v);
    
    // 3. Apply attention weights: attn_weights @ v_t
    let attn_output = matmul_attention(attn_weights, v_t);
    
    // 4. Transpose back to [seq, n_heads, head_dim]
    let attn_output_t = transpose_back(attn_output);
    
    // 5. Merge heads to [seq, dim]
    let merged = merge_heads(attn_output_t);
    
    // 6. Apply output projection
    let output = merged @ c_proj_weight + c_proj_bias;
    
    output
}
```

### Critical Fix

**Issue:** Initial implementation used `.dot(&self.c_proj_weight.t())` which was incorrect.

**Root Cause:** PyTorch's `F.linear(x, w, b)` computes `x @ w.T + b`. The extraction script passes `c_proj_weight.T`, so `F.linear(x, w.T, b)` = `x @ (w.T).T + b` = `x @ w + b`.

**Solution:** Changed to `.dot(&self.c_proj_weight)` (NO transpose).
