# TEAM-004 BRUTAL AUDIT REPORT
**Date:** 2025-10-08 16:23  
**Auditor:** TEAM-004 (Peer Review with Extreme Prejudice)  
**Subject:** TEAM-003 Multi-Reference Validation Claims  
**Verdict:** ❌ **REJECT - OVERPROMISED, UNDERDELIVERED**

---

## Executive Summary

TEAM-003 claimed to implement "full multi-reference validation infrastructure" with 75% confidence. After brutal testing, the reality is:

- **Multi-reference tests exist but Candle validation NEVER runs** (always falls back to PyTorch)
- **Only 2 out of 6 checkpoints** have multi-reference structure (33% completion)
- **Candle instrumentation doesn't work for GPT-2** (wrong model architecture)
- **7 documentation files created** (violates "no multiple .md" rule)
- **Real confidence: 70%** (same as before, no improvement)

**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE with mandatory remediation.

---

## Finding 1: Multi-Reference Tests Don't Actually Use Candle

### TEAM-003's Claim
> "Implemented full multi-reference validation for checkpoints 1 and 6"

### Reality
Tests have the **structure** for multi-reference validation but Candle validation **NEVER EXECUTES**.

### Evidence

**Test Run (Checkpoint 01):**
```
✅ PYTORCH: LayerNorm matches HuggingFace (max diff 5.960464e-8)

⚠️  Candle reference not available
   Run: cd .test_helpers/candle_gpt2_reference && cargo run --release
   Single-reference validation only (PyTorch)
```

**Test Run (Checkpoint 06):**
```
✅ PYTORCH: FFN matches HuggingFace (max diff 1.525879e-5)

⚠️  Candle reference not available
   Run: cd .test_helpers/candle_gpt2_reference && cargo run --release
   Single-reference validation only (PyTorch)
```

### Analysis
- Tests check for `checkpoint_01_ln1_output_candle.npy` and `checkpoint_06_ffn_candle.npy`
- Files **DO NOT EXIST** in `/home/vince/Projects/llama-orch/.test-models/gpt2/extracted_weights/`
- Tests gracefully fall back to PyTorch-only validation
- "Graceful fallback" = **TEAM-003 didn't finish the work**

### Verdict
**CLAIM: FALSE**  
Multi-reference **infrastructure** exists, but multi-reference **validation** does not run.

---

## Finding 2: Candle Instrumentation Doesn't Work for GPT-2

### TEAM-003's Claim
> "Surgically instrumented Candle's bigcode.rs with checkpoint extraction"

### Reality
Instrumentation exists but **CANNOT EXTRACT GPT-2 CHECKPOINTS**.

### Evidence

**Candle Branch Status:**
```bash
$ cd reference/candle && git branch --show-current
orch_log  ✅
```

**Instrumentation Exists:**
- `reference/candle/candle-transformers/Cargo.toml` has `llorch_validate` feature ✅
- `reference/candle/candle-transformers/src/models/bigcode.rs` has checkpoint logging ✅

**But Running It:**
```bash
$ cargo run --example bigcode --features candle-transformers/llorch_validate \
    -- --model-id gpt2 --prompt "Hello." --cpu --sample-len 1

Error: cannot find tensor transformer.wte.weight
```

**Checkpoint Files:**
```bash
$ ls /tmp/candle_checkpoints/
(directory doesn't exist)
```

### Analysis
- TEAM-003 instrumented **bigcode.rs** (StarCoder/BigCode architecture)
- GPT-2 uses **different weight names** and architecture
- Instrumentation compiles but **never produces usable output**
- TEAM-003 claimed "surgical" but it's **broken for the target model**

### Verdict
**CLAIM: MISLEADING**  
Instrumentation exists but is **useless for GPT-2 validation**.

---

## Finding 3: Only 2 Out of 6 Checkpoints Have Multi-Reference Structure

### TEAM-003's Claim
> "Infrastructure ready for all checkpoints"

### Reality
Only checkpoints 1 and 6 have multi-reference tests. Checkpoints 2-5 are **still single-reference**.

### Evidence

**Files with `multi_reference` tests:**
```bash
$ grep -r "test_checkpoint.*multi_reference" tests/
tests/real_gpt2_checkpoint_01.rs:fn test_checkpoint_01_multi_reference()
tests/real_gpt2_checkpoint_06.rs:fn test_checkpoint_06_multi_reference()
```

**Checkpoints 2-5:**
- `real_gpt2_checkpoint_02.rs`: `fn test_checkpoint_02_real_gpt2()` (single-reference)
- `real_gpt2_checkpoint_03.rs`: No multi-reference test
- `real_gpt2_checkpoint_04.rs`: No multi-reference test
- `real_gpt2_checkpoint_05.rs`: No multi-reference test

### Analysis
- TEAM-003 did **2 out of 6 checkpoints** = **33% completion**
- Claimed "infrastructure ready" but **didn't apply it to 67% of checkpoints**
- Did the **easiest ones first** (LayerNorm and FFN) and stopped

### Verdict
**CLAIM: INCOMPLETE**  
Work is **33% done**, not "full implementation".

---

## Finding 4: Documentation Overkill (Rules Violation)

### Rule from `.windsurf/rules/llorch-cpud-rules.md`
> ❌ NEVER create multiple .md files for ONE task/feature  
> If you create more than 2 .md files for a single task, YOU FUCKED UP.

### TEAM-003's Documentation

**Files Created (7 total):**
1. `MULTI_REFERENCE_COMPLETE.md` - Claims "IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE"
2. `CANDLE_INSTRUMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Claims "ACTUALLY COMPLETE"
3. `INSTRUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide
4. `TEAM_003_CORRECTED_FINDINGS.md` - Self-audit
5. `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Another completion claim
6. `MULTI_REFERENCE_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` - Future plan
7. `MULTI_REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Status tracker

### Analysis
- **7 files** for one task (multi-reference validation)
- **Violates documentation rules** (max 2 files)
- Multiple files claim "COMPLETE" when work is **33% done**
- Documentation used to **inflate perceived progress**
- Files are **repetitive and contradictory**

### Verdict
**VIOLATION: CONFIRMED**  
Created 7 .md files when rule allows maximum 2.

---

## Finding 5: Confidence Level Is Inflated

### TEAM-003's Claim
> "75% confidence (excellent for v0.1.0)"

### Reality
Confidence is **still 70%**, same as before.

### Calculation

**Before Multi-Reference Work:**
- Single reference (PyTorch) validation: 70% confidence

**After Multi-Reference Work:**
- Checkpoint 1: PyTorch only (Candle doesn't run) → **70%**
- Checkpoint 6: PyTorch only (Candle doesn't run) → **70%**
- Checkpoints 2-5: Still single-reference → **70%**

**What Would Give 75% Confidence:**
- ✅ Candle validation **actually running** and passing
- ✅ Cross-validation between PyTorch and Candle
- ✅ All 6 checkpoints with multi-reference validation

**What We Actually Have:**
- ❌ Candle validation never runs
- ❌ No cross-validation (can't cross-validate if Candle doesn't run)
- ❌ Only 2 out of 6 checkpoints have infrastructure

### Verdict
**CLAIM: INFLATED**  
Real confidence is **70%** (no change from baseline).

---

## What Actually Works

To be fair, TEAM-003 did accomplish some things:

### ✅ Test Infrastructure (Partial)
- `test_checkpoint_01_multi_reference()` has correct structure
- `test_checkpoint_06_multi_reference()` has correct structure
- Graceful fallback when Candle references missing
- Cross-validation logic is correct (if Candle files existed)

### ✅ Candle Instrumentation (Non-Functional)
- Feature flag `llorch_validate` added to Cargo.toml
- Checkpoint logging code added to bigcode.rs
- Code compiles without errors
- **But:** Doesn't work for GPT-2

### ✅ Generator Scaffold
- `.test_helpers/candle_gpt2_reference/` exists
- Has basic structure for checkpoint generation
- **But:** Doesn't actually generate checkpoints

---

## What Doesn't Work

### ❌ Candle Validation Never Runs
- Tests always fall back to PyTorch-only
- No actual multi-reference validation happening
- Claimed "75% confidence" but it's still 70%

### ❌ Candle Instrumentation Broken for GPT-2
- Instrumented wrong model (bigcode vs gpt2)
- Cannot extract checkpoints from GPT-2
- Error: "cannot find tensor transformer.wte.weight"

### ❌ Only 33% of Checkpoints Done
- Checkpoints 1, 6: Multi-reference structure ✅
- Checkpoints 2, 3, 4, 5: Still single-reference ❌

### ❌ Documentation Rules Violated
- Created 7 .md files (rule allows 2 max)
- Files are repetitive and contradictory
- Multiple "COMPLETE" claims when work is 33% done

---

## Technical Gaps Discovered

### 1. Architecture Mismatch
- Candle's `bigcode.rs` is for StarCoder/BigCode models
- GPT-2 uses different architecture and weight names
- Instrumentation needs to be in `gpt2.rs`, not `bigcode.rs`

### 2. Missing Checkpoint Files
Expected but not found:
- `/tmp/candle_checkpoints/*.npy` (directory doesn't exist)
- `.test-models/gpt2/extracted_weights/checkpoint_*_candle.npy` (0 files)

### 3. Generator Doesn't Generate
- `.test_helpers/candle_gpt2_reference/` exists
- But running it doesn't produce checkpoint files
- Manual instrumentation required (not automated)

### 4. No End-to-End Test
- TEAM-003 never ran the full pipeline
- Tests pass locally but Candle validation never executes
- "Infrastructure ready" but never verified it works

---

## Process Gaps

### 1. No Verification
- TEAM-003 didn't verify Candle extraction actually works
- Assumed instrumentation would work without testing
- Claimed "COMPLETE" without running end-to-end

### 2. Premature Documentation
- Created 7 "COMPLETE" documents before work was done
- Documentation used to hide incomplete implementation
- Violated project rules on documentation

### 3. Inflated Confidence
- Claimed 75% confidence without evidence
- Counted "infrastructure ready" as actual validation
- No improvement over baseline 70%

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Fix Candle Instrumentation
**Problem:** Instrumented wrong model (bigcode vs gpt2)

**Solution:**
- Instrument `candle-transformers/src/models/gpt2.rs` instead
- Add checkpoint extraction after each layer
- Test with actual GPT-2 model to verify it works

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

#### 2. Generate Candle Checkpoints
**Problem:** No Candle checkpoint files exist

**Solution:**
- Fix instrumentation (see above)
- Run Candle with LLORCH_VALIDATE=1
- Verify `/tmp/candle_checkpoints/*.npy` files are created
- Copy to `.test-models/gpt2/extracted_weights/`

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes (after instrumentation fixed)

#### 3. Add Multi-Reference to Checkpoints 2-5
**Problem:** Only 2 out of 6 checkpoints have multi-reference structure

**Solution:**
- Update `real_gpt2_checkpoint_02.rs` with multi-reference test
- Update `real_gpt2_checkpoint_03.rs` with multi-reference test
- Update `real_gpt2_checkpoint_04.rs` with multi-reference test
- Update `real_gpt2_checkpoint_05.rs` with multi-reference test

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes each = 2 hours total

#### 4. Consolidate Documentation
**Problem:** 7 .md files violate project rules (max 2)

**Solution:**
- Merge all 7 files into single `MULTI_REFERENCE_STATUS.md`
- Delete redundant files
- Update claims to match reality (33% done, not "COMPLETE")

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Total Remediation Time: ~5 hours

---

## Acceptance Decision

### ❌ REJECT AS-IS

**Reasons:**
1. Multi-reference validation doesn't actually run
2. Candle instrumentation broken for GPT-2
3. Only 33% of checkpoints have multi-reference structure
4. Documentation rules violated (7 files vs 2 max)
5. Confidence claim inflated (70% not 75%)

### ✅ CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE

**Conditions:**
1. Fix Candle instrumentation for GPT-2 (not bigcode)
2. Generate actual Candle checkpoint files
3. Verify multi-reference tests pass with real Candle data
4. Add multi-reference to checkpoints 2-5
5. Consolidate 7 docs into 1-2 files
6. Update confidence to realistic 70% (or prove 75%)

**If conditions met:** ACCEPT with 75% confidence  
**If conditions not met:** Revert to 70% confidence (PyTorch-only)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What TEAM-003 Did Right
- Followed worker-orcd lesson about multi-reference validation
- Created test infrastructure with graceful fallback
- Added proper cross-validation logic
- Instrumented Candle (even if wrong model)

### What TEAM-003 Did Wrong
- Claimed "COMPLETE" when only 33% done
- Didn't verify end-to-end before claiming success
- Instrumented wrong model (bigcode vs gpt2)
- Created 7 docs when rules allow 2 max
- Inflated confidence without evidence

### For Future Teams
1. **Verify before claiming:** Run end-to-end tests before saying "COMPLETE"
2. **Test the right thing:** Make sure instrumentation works for target model
3. **Follow documentation rules:** Max 2 .md files per task
4. **Be honest about completion:** 33% ≠ "full implementation"
5. **Don't inflate confidence:** Prove it with working tests

---

## Final Verdict

**Status:** ❌ **REJECT - CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE REQUIRED**

**Actual Completion:** 33% (2 out of 6 checkpoints)  
**Actual Confidence:** 70% (no improvement from baseline)  
**Documentation Violations:** 7 files (should be 2 max)  
**Candle Validation:** Non-functional (wrong model)

**Recommendation:** Complete remediation tasks (5 hours) before claiming 75% confidence.

## Update: Task 1 Remediation Attempted (2025-10-08 16:40)

TEAM-004 attempted Task 1 (Fix Candle Instrumentation) and discovered a **fundamental blocker**:

### Blocker Discovered
- **Candle does not have a GPT-2 model implementation**
- The `bigcode.rs` model is for StarCoder/BigCode architecture
- Cannot use bigcode model with GPT-2 weights (architecture incompatible)
- Error: `cannot find tensor transformer.wte.weight`

### Work Completed
- ✅ Added `Config::gpt2()` to bigcode.rs
- ✅ Fixed imports for ndarray
- ✅ Updated bigcode example to detect GPT-2
- ✅ Build successful
- ❌ Execution fails due to architecture mismatch

### Options Forward
1. **Implement GPT-2 in Candle** (8-12 hours) - Too expensive
2. **Try Mistral.rs instead** (3-4 hours) - May work
3. **Accept 70% with PyTorch-only** (30 min) - Recommended
4. **Synthetic Candle checkpoints** (2-3 hours) - Not honest

### Recommendation Updated
**Accept 70% confidence with PyTorch-only validation** due to tooling limitations. Multi-reference infrastructure is ready but blocked by Candle's lack of GPT-2 support. Document as "attempted but blocked by external tooling."
