- Explained tinygrad's `triu(start_pos.val+1)` implementation

### ✅ 5. Specified Biased Variance in LayerNorm

**Fix Applied:**
- Explicitly stated "biased variance (denominator = N, not N-1)"
- Provided correct formula with step-by-step calculation
- Added epsilon purpose explanation
- Added note distinguishing LayerNorm from RmsNorm

### ✅ 6. Explained KV Cache Stacking
**Location:** Section 5.3  
**Problem:** "Stack" operation unclear

- Clarified dimension 0: index 0=keys, 1=values
- Provided equivalent code for standard implementations (PyTorch/Rust)
- Added cache structure breakdown by dimension

### ✅ 7. Documented "Realize" as Tinygrad-Specific
**Location:** Section 5.3 and throughout  
**Problem:** `.realize()` not explained  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added "TINYGRAD-SPECIFIC NOTE" section
- Explained lazy evaluation concept
- Stated eager frameworks should ignore all `.realize()` calls
- Marked all realize mentions as tinygrad-specific

### ✅ 8. Resolved GELU Formula Ambiguity
**Location:** Section 6.2  
**Problem:** Two formulas given, unclear which to use  
**Fix Applied:**
- Separated into "Option 1: Exact GELU (RECOMMENDED)" and "Option 2: Tanh Approximation"
- Provided both formulas clearly
- Added recommendation to use exact GELU
- Noted both produce nearly identical results

### ✅ 9. Added Inference-Only Scope Note
**Location:** Document header  
**Problem:** Scope not clearly stated  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added "Scope: INFERENCE ONLY (training is out of scope)" to header
- Added "IMPORTANT NOTES" section
- Clarified tinygrad-specific optimizations are marked
- Noted framework-agnostic approach
