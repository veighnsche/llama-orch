# llorch-cpud - CPU-based GPT-2 Inference

**Status:** Checkpoints 1 & 2 mathematically validated (synthetic weights)  
**Production:** ‚ùå NOT validated with real GPT-2 weights yet

---

## Quick Start - Real Model Validation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install torch transformers numpy

# Run real GPT-2 validation
./RUN_REAL_VALIDATION.sh
```

See **[REAL_GPT2_VALIDATION.md](REAL_GPT2_VALIDATION.md)** for details.

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Checkpoints Completed
- **Checkpoint 1:** LayerNorm - Mathematically correct with synthetic weights
- **Checkpoint 2:** QKV Projection - Mathematically correct with synthetic weights

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Status
- **Synthetic weights:** ‚úÖ Validated against test harnesses (Candle, Mistral.rs)
- **Real GPT-2 weights:** ‚ùå NOT YET VALIDATED (implementation ready, needs execution)

## Quick Summary

### worker-orcd Status

- **Duration:** 23 days (Sep 15 - Oct 8, 2025)
- **Code:** 85,601 lines (60% C++, 20% CUDA, 19% Rust)
- **Teams:** 40+ investigation teams deployed
- **Commits:** 711 (99% single developer)
- **Bugs "found":** 7+ (all symptoms or false leads)
- **Root cause:** NOT FOUND
- **Status:** üî¥ STILL BROKEN

### Critical Discovery

**Every team thought they found the root cause. Every team was wrong.**

**The fundamental comparison with llama.cpp was never completed.**

## The Pattern of False Victories

### "Root Cause Found" ‚Üí FALSE LEAD

**TEAM DICKINSON:** "GGUF is column-major, we need to transpose!"  
**Reality:** Already transposing via CUBLAS_OP_T  
**Time wasted:** 3 hours  
**File:** `TRANSPOSE_FALSE_LEAD.md`

### "Victory!" ‚Üí FALSE FIX

**TEAM SENTINEL:** "Fixed cuBLAS parameters!"  
**Reality:** Math correct, output still garbage  
**File:** `TEAM_SENTINEL_VICTORY.md` (actual title: "FALSE FIX")

### "Fixed!" ‚Üí STILL BROKEN

**TEAM BRAVO:** Attempt #4 - "STILL BROKEN - Different repetitive token"  
**TEAM BLUE:** "TOKENIZATION FIXED BUT MODEL STILL BROKEN"  
**TEAM GREEN:** "APPLIED (BUT OUTPUT STILL BROKEN)"

### Pattern

1. Investigate deeply
2. Find something
3. Fix it
4. Test it
5. **Still broken**
6. Hand off to next team
7. Repeat 40+ times

---

## The Uninvestigated Path

### What Should Have Been Done

**Day 1:**
```bash
# Instrument llama.cpp to dump post-embedding values
# Compare with our post-embedding values
# If different ‚Üí Fix embedding
# If same ‚Üí Move to layer 1
```

**Day 2:**
```bash
# Compare layer 1 output
# If different ‚Üí Fix layer 1
# If same ‚Üí Move to layer 2
```

**Repeat until all layers match.**

**Estimated time:** 1-2 days, not 23 days.

### What Actually Happened

**Day 1-23:**
```bash
# Fix softmax ‚Üí Still broken
# Fix sampling ‚Üí Still broken
# Fix cuBLAS ‚Üí Still broken
# Fix weights ‚Üí Still broken
# Fix config ‚Üí Still broken
# Deploy 40+ teams ‚Üí Still broken
```

**Actual time:** 23 days, still not fixed.

## Critical Lessons for llorch-cpud

### The Golden Rule

**COMPARE WITH REFERENCE AT EVERY STEP**

```rust
#[test]
fn test_component_matches_reference() {
    let our_output = our_component(input);
    let reference_output = llama_cpp_component(input);
    
    // If this fails, STOP
    // Don't move forward
    // Don't declare "partial fix"
    // Fix it until it passes
    assert_eq!(our_output, reference_output);
}
```

### The Strategy

1. **Start simple:** CPU + GPT-2 (not CUDA + Qwen)
2. **Compare early:** From day 1, not day 23
3. **Find first divergence:** Where do we differ from llama.cpp?
4. **Fix that one thing:** Don't fix symptoms
5. **Verify it matches:** No "mathematically correct but wrong"
6. **Move forward:** Only after verification passes

### The Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå "Mathematically correct but output wrong"  
‚ùå "Partial fix, still investigating"  
‚ùå "Fixed one component, model still broken"  
‚ùå "This looks like the root cause"  
‚ùå "Let's try fixing this and see"

‚úÖ "Matches reference? Yes or no."

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Team Analysis (Week 2)

Analyze why each team thought they won and why they were wrong.

### Phase 3: Technical Autopsy (Week 3)

Deep dive into what the actual root cause might be (if findable).

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis (Week 4)

Why did the process fail? Why no reference comparison?

### Phase 5: Post-Mortem (Week 5)

Complete documentation for future teams.

### Phase 6: llorch-cpud Foundation (Week 6+)

Apply all lessons to build CPU-based GPT-2 inference correctly.

## The Bottom Line

**worker-orcd:** 85K lines, 40+ teams, 23 days ‚Üí STILL BROKEN

**Why:** No systematic comparison with reference implementation

**llorch-cpud:** Will succeed by doing what worker-orcd didn't

**How:** Compare with llama.cpp at every single step
