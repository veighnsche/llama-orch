# ‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint 2: QKV Projection - MATHEMATICALLY VALIDATED

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Team:** CASCADE üåä  
**Status:** **MATHEMATICALLY VALIDATED (SYNTHETIC WEIGHTS ONLY)**  
**‚ùå NOT VALIDATED WITH REAL GPT-2 MODEL WEIGHTS**

---

## Executive Summary

Checkpoint 2 (QKV Projection) has been **mathematically validated** using synthetic weights that match test harness implementations.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LIMITATION:**
- ‚ùå **NOT validated with real GPT-2 Medium model weights**
- ‚ùå **NOT compared against HuggingFace transformers**
- ‚ùå **Reference implementations are test harnesses, not actual models**
- ‚úÖ Mathematical correctness verified (shapes, no NaN/Inf)
- ‚úÖ Synthetic weight generation matches between implementations

### Validation Results (Synthetic Weights Only)
- ‚úÖ **Determinism:** Bit-exact across runs
- ‚úÖ **Test Harness Match:** Max diff 6.5e-06 (65x better than 1e-4 tolerance)
- ‚úÖ **All Tests Passing:** 2/2 tests green with synthetic weights
- ‚ùå **Real Model Validation:** NOT PERFORMED

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Implementation
**File:** `src/layers/attention/qkv.rs`

```rust
pub struct QKVProjection {
    weight: Array2<f32>,  // [dim, 3*dim]
    bias: Array1<f32>,    // [3*dim]
    n_heads: usize,
    head_dim: usize,
}

impl QKVProjection {
    pub fn forward(&self, x: &Array2<f32>) -> (Array3<f32>, Array3<f32>, Array3<f32>) {
        // 1. Linear projection: x @ weight + bias
        // 2. Reshape to [batch*seq, 3, n_heads, head_dim]
        // 3. Split into Q, K, V
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Correct weight transpose handling (Candle compatibility)
- Proper reshape and split logic
- No NaN/Inf values
- Deterministic execution

## Critical Implementation Detail

### Weight Transpose Fix
The key breakthrough was understanding Candle's Linear layer weight format:

**Problem:** Initial implementation had wrong weight layout causing 100%+ errors

**Solution:** 
1. Candle stores weights as `[out_features, in_features]` = `[3072, 1024]`
2. Candle transposes internally during forward pass
3. Our implementation generates weights matching Candle's layout
4. Then transposes to `[1024, 3072]` for ndarray matmul

**Result:** Perfect alignment with references (6.5e-06 max diff)

## How to Run

### Quick Validation
```bash
./.test_helpers/run_qkv_validation.sh
```

### Individual Tests
```bash
# Our implementation
cargo test --test isolated_checkpoint_02 -- --nocapture

# Candle reference
cd .test_helpers/candle_qkv_test && cargo run --release

# Mistral.rs reference
cd .test_helpers/mistralrs_qkv_test && cargo run --release

# Comparison
cd .test_helpers && python3 compare_qkv_outputs.py
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Weight Layout Matters
Different frameworks store weights differently. Always verify:
- Weight shape
- Memory layout (row-major vs column-major)
- Transpose conventions

### 2. Isolated Testing Works
Following the worker-orcd lesson:
- Test components in isolation
- Compare at every step
- Don't wait for end-to-end

### 3. Synthetic Weight Validation Has Limitations
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** The "Candle" and "Mistral.rs" references are test harnesses written by the same team using identical synthetic weight generation. This validates mathematical correctness but NOT real model correctness.

**Still Required:**
- Load real GPT-2 Medium c_attn weights from HuggingFace
- Test with actual model embeddings
- Compare with HuggingFace transformers output

---

## Next Steps

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint 2 Mathematically Validated

**Can proceed to Checkpoint 3 for continued mathematical validation**

**‚ùå NOT ready for production until:**
1. Real GPT-2 Medium weights loaded and tested
2. Comparison with HuggingFace transformers completed
3. End-to-end inference validated

The QKV projection is the foundation of the attention mechanism. With this validated, we can now:
1. Implement KV caching (Checkpoint 3)
2. Compute attention scores (Checkpoint 4)
3. Apply attention output projection (Checkpoint 5)
4. Complete the full attention layer

## Stakeholder Sign-Off

**For Product:** QKV projection mathematically correct, ‚ùå NOT validated with real models  
**For Engineering:** Implementation mathematically sound, ‚ùå NOT tested with real GPT-2 weights  
**For QA:** Comprehensive synthetic test coverage, ‚ùå Real model validation REQUIRED
