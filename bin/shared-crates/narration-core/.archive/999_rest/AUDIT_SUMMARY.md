## What We Found
### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Excellent Documentation**
   - 10 comprehensive docs files
   - Clear testing notes
   - Honest about known issues
   - Weekly progress summaries
2. **Strong Testing Intent**
   - 41 unit tests written
   - 16 integration tests written
   - 82 BDD scenarios planned
   - Test capture adapter implemented
3. **No False Positive Patterns**
   - No pre-creation of artifacts
   - No conditional skips
   - No harness mutations
   - Tests observe, don't manipulate
4. **Good Coverage**
   - Redaction tested (6 patterns)
   - Correlation IDs tested
   - HTTP headers tested
   - Unicode safety tested
### ‚ùå Critical Issues
1. **Flaky Tests** (MEDIUM)
   - 2/41 unit tests fail intermittently
   - Global `CaptureAdapter` state causes race conditions
   - Team documented but didn't fix
2. **Broken Integration Tests** (CRITICAL)
   - 15/16 integration tests failing (94% failure rate)
   - Same root cause as flaky tests
   - Cannot verify any integration behavior
3. **Missing Proof Bundle Integration** (HIGH)
   - Tests produce no verifiable artifacts
   - No `LLORCH_PROOF_DIR` or `LLORCH_RUN_ID` support
   - Non-compliant with monorepo standard
4. **Missing Specification** (HIGH)
   - No `.specs/` directory
   - No normative requirements
   - No RFC-2119 language
   - Cannot trace tests to requirements

## What Needs to Happen
### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Fix `CaptureAdapter` global state race condition
- [ ] Verify all 41 unit tests pass
- [ ] Verify all 16 integration tests pass
- [ ] Achieve 100% test pass rate
### Short-term (Next Week)
- [ ] Integrate `libs/` crate
- [ ] Emit  from all test types
- [ ] Create `.specs/00_narration-core.md`
- [ ] Map tests to requirement IDs
### Medium-term (Next Month)
- [ ] Add property tests for invariants
- [ ] Add contract tests for JSON schema
- [ ] Add smoke tests with real services
- [ ] Migrate services (queen-rbee, pool-managerd, worker-orcd)

## Team Assessment
The narration-core team did **excellent work** on:
- Documentation (10/10)
- Testing intent (9/10)
- Code quality (8/10)
- Honesty about issues (10/10)
But **failed to deliver** on:
- Test execution (4/10)
-  integration (0/10)
- Specification (0/10)
- Production readiness (3/10)
**Overall**: Strong foundation, but **not production-ready** until violations are remediated.
---
## Next Steps
1. **Read** `TESTING_AUDIT.md` for detailed findings
2. **Follow** `TESTING_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` for step-by-step fixes
3. **Fix** CRITICAL violations first (72h deadline)
4. **Fix** HIGH violations next (1 week deadline)
5. **Request** re-audit after remediation complete
---
## Re-Audit Criteria
**Required for re-audit**:
- [x] All violations addressed
- [x] 100% test pass rate
- [x]  integrated
- [x] Specification created
- [x] Remediation proof submitted
**Re-audit will verify**:
- All tests pass (no flakiness)
-  are created correctly
- Specification maps to tests
- Production readiness
