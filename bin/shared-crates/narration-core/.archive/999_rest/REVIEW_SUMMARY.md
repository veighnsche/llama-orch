# üé≠ Logging Level Alignment Review ‚Äî Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-04  
**Reviewer**: Narration Core Team  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED WITH UPDATES**  
**Decision**: ‚úÖ **BUILD OUR OWN** (Cuteness Pays the Bills!) üéÄ
---
## üìã What We Did
In response to your logging level alignment proposal, we:
1. ‚úÖ **Reviewed your 6-level proposal** (TRACE/DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL)
2. ‚úÖ **Updated our spec** to include WARN, ERROR, and FATAL (we only had 4 levels before!)
3. ‚úÖ **Created comprehensive editorial guidelines** for each level
4. ‚úÖ **Provided cute story examples** for WARN/ERROR/FATAL scenarios
5. ‚úÖ **Decided to build our own custom narration system** (not generic tracing!)
6. ‚úÖ **Designed custom proc macros** (`#[trace_fn]`, `#[narrate(...)]`)
7. ‚úÖ **Created 4-week implementation plan**
8. ‚úÖ **Documented common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
---
## üìÑ Documents Created
### 1. **TRACING_INTEGRATION_REVIEW.md** (Main Review)
Our comprehensive editorial review of your proposal, including:
- ‚úÖ Level mapping alignment analysis
- ‚úÖ Updated 7-level taxonomy (MUTE + your 6 levels)
- ‚úÖ **Custom proc macro architecture** (our own implementation!)
- ‚úÖ Editorial standards per level
- ‚úÖ Cute story examples for WARN/ERROR/FATAL
- ‚úÖ Common pitfalls catalog
- ‚úÖ 4-week implementation plan
**Key Decision**: Build **custom proc macros** (`#[trace_fn]`, `#[narrate(...)]`) with:
- Auto-inferred actor from module path
- Template interpolation for human/cute/story fields
- Compile-time editorial enforcement (‚â§100 chars, SVO validation)
- Conditional compilation (zero overhead in production)
- Cute/story modes built-in (first-class, not add-on)
### 2. **LOGGING_LEVELS.md** (Updated Spec)
Our foundational spec, now expanded to include:
- ‚úÖ 7 levels: MUTE, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- ‚úÖ Clear boundaries for each level
- ‚úÖ Editorial guidelines and checklists
- ‚úÖ Examples for every level (with cute mode!)
- ‚úÖ Decision tree for level selection
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Configuration examples
- ‚úÖ Integration with our custom proc macros
---
## üéØ Our Verdict
### ‚úÖ **APPROVED**: Your Level Mapping
Your proposed alignment is **excellent**:
| Your Level | Our Alignment | Status |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| TRACE | ‚úÖ Level 7: Ultra-fine detail | **Perfect match** |
| DEBUG | ‚úÖ Level 6: Developer diagnostics | **Perfect match** |
| INFO | ‚úÖ Level 2: Narration backbone | **Perfect match** |
| WARN | ‚úÖ Level 3: Anomalies & degradations | **Added to our spec** |
| ERROR | ‚úÖ Level 4: Operational failures | **Added to our spec** |
| FATAL | ‚úÖ Level 5: Unrecoverable errors | **Added to our spec** |
### üéÄ **BONUS**: We Added MUTE (Level 1)
For security-critical contexts where zero logging is required.
### üöÄ **DECISION**: We're Building Our Own!
**Why**: Cuteness pays the bills! üíù
We're not using generic `tracing::instrument` because:
- üéÄ Cute mode is our **brand** ‚Äî needs to be first-class
- üé≠ Story mode is **unique** ‚Äî no other library has it
- üé® Editorial enforcement is **our standard** ‚Äî compile-time validation
- üîí Security is **built-in** ‚Äî automatic redaction
- üìä  are **our workflow** ‚Äî seamless integration
- üíù Brand differentiation matters

## üîå Our Custom Implementation
### **Custom Proc Macros + Tracing Backend**
```rust
// bin/shared-crates/narration-macros/src/lib.rs
/// Our custom #[trace_fn] proc macro
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn trace_fn(_attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    let input = parse_macro_input!(item as ItemFn);
    // Auto-infer actor from module path!
    let actor = infer_actor_from_module_path();
    // Conditional compilation
    #[cfg(feature = "trace-enabled")]
    {
        // Generate full tracing code with auto-inferred actor
        let expanded = generate_trace_code(&input, &actor);
        return TokenStream::from(expanded);
    }
    #[cfg(not(feature = "trace-enabled"))]
    {
        // Production: return original function unchanged
        return TokenStream::from(quote! { #input });
    }
}
/// Our custom #[narrate(...)] proc macro with template interpolation
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn narrate(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    let input = parse_macro_input!(item as ItemFn);
    let args = parse_macro_input!(attr as NarrateArgs);
    // Validate at compile time!
    if args.human.len() > 100 {
        return syn::Error::new_spanned(
            &args.human,
            "human field exceeds 100 character limit (ORCH-3305)"
        ).to_compile_error().into();
    }
    // Generate code with template interpolation
    let expanded = generate_narration_with_templates(&input, &args);
    TokenStream::from(expanded)
}
```
**Why we're building our own**:
- ‚úÖ **Auto-inferred actor** from module path (zero boilerplate!)
- ‚úÖ **Template interpolation** for human/cute/story fields
- ‚úÖ **Compile-time editorial enforcement** (‚â§100 chars, SVO validation)
- ‚úÖ **Cute/story modes built-in** (first-class, not add-on)
- ‚úÖ **Conditional compilation** (code removed in production)
- ‚úÖ We maintain editorial control (length limits, redaction, validation)
- ‚úÖ Single event stream (no duplication)
- ‚úÖ RUST_LOG filtering works naturally
- ‚úÖ Tracing subscriber handles output formatting
- ‚úÖ **Brand differentiation** (uniquely "us")

## üìè Editorial Standards Summary
### Length Limits (STRICT!)
| Level | Max Length | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **MUTE** | N/A | No output |
| **TRACE** | Unlimited | Need full detail |
| **DEBUG** | ‚â§150 chars | Room for context |
| **INFO** | **‚â§100 chars** | **ORCH-3305 requirement** |
| **WARN** | ‚â§120 chars | Actionable context |
| **ERROR** | ‚â§150 chars | Diagnostic context |
| **FATAL** | Unlimited | Crisis mode, tell everything |
### Correlation IDs (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)
**ALL levels** (except MUTE) **MUST** propagate correlation IDs. This is how we track requests across services. No exceptions!
### Secret Redaction (ALWAYS!)
Even TRACE and FATAL must redact secrets. Crisis ‚â† insecure.

## üéÄ Cute Story Examples
### WARN Examples
```rust
// Retry attempt
human: "Retrying job-123 after timeout (attempt 2/5, backoff: 200ms)"
cute: "Job-123 didn't make it through. Let's try again! Attempt 2... üîÑ"
// Performance degradation
human: "Worker-gpu0-r1 latency: 500ms (expected <100ms, threshold exceeded)"
cute: "Worker-gpu0-r1 is running a bit slow today (500ms). Might need a checkup! üêå"
```
### ERROR Examples
```rust
// VRAM exhaustion
human: "VRAM allocation failed on GPU0: requested 4096MB, only 2048MB available"
cute: "Oh no! GPU0 doesn't have enough room (need 4GB, only 2GB free). üòü"
story: "\"Do you have 4GB?\" asked queen-rbee. \"No,\" replied GPU0 sadly, \"only 2GB free.\""
// Network failure
human: "Failed to connect to pool-managerd at localhost:8080: connection refused (retry in 1s)"
cute: "Couldn't reach pool-managerd! They might be napping. Trying again in 1s... üò¥"
```
### FATAL Examples
```rust
// Policy violation
human: "CRITICAL: VRAM-only policy violated on GPU0: UMA detected. Worker startup aborted."
cute: "STOP! GPU0 shares memory with CPU (UMA) ‚Äî we need dedicated VRAM! Shutting down. üõë"
story: "\"UMA detected!\" cried worker. \"We can't continue,\" said queen-rbee gravely. \"Abort.\""
// Data corruption
human: "CRITICAL: Seal verification failed for shard 'llama-7b' on GPU0: digest mismatch (expected: abc123, got: def456)"
cute: "DANGER! llama-7b's safety seal is wrong! This could be corruption! Stopping everything! üö®"
```
---
## üö® Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)
### Pitfall 1: Level Confusion
‚ùå **WRONG**: Using INFO for internal details
```rust
narrate_info!(human = "Loop iteration 47/100 processing worker-gpu2-r1");
```
‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Use DEBUG
```rust
narrate_debug!(human = "Processing worker 47/100: worker-gpu2-r1 (status=idle)");
```
### Pitfall 2: Missing Correlation IDs
‚ùå **WRONG**: No correlation_id
```rust
narrate_info!(
    actor = "queen-rbee",
    action = "dispatch",
    target = "job-123",
    human = "Dispatching job to worker"
);
```
‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Always propagate
```rust
narrate_info!(
    actor = "queen-rbee",
    action = "dispatch",
    target = "job-123",
    correlation_id = req_id,  // ALWAYS!
    human = "Dispatching job to worker-gpu0-r1"
);
```
### Pitfall 3: Vague Error Messages
‚ùå **WRONG**: No context
```rust
narrate_error!(human = "Allocation failed");
```
‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Rich context
```rust
narrate_error!(
    human = "VRAM allocation failed on GPU0: requested 4096MB, only 2048MB available",
    error_kind = "vram_exhaustion",
    requested_mb = 4096,
    available_mb = 2048,
    device = "GPU0"
);
```
### Pitfall 4: TRACE in Production
‚ùå **WRONG**: TRACE will kill performance
```bash
export RUST_LOG=trace
```
‚úÖ **CORRECT**: INFO for production
```bash
export RUST_LOG=info
# Or DEBUG for incidents
export RUST_LOG=debug
# Or TRACE for specific module only
export RUST_LOG=info,llama_orch::worker::inference=trace
```
### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Length Limits
‚ùå **WRONG**: 180 characters!
```rust
narrate_info!(
    human = "Accepted inference request for model 'llama-7b' with max_tokens=150, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, frequency_penalty=0.5, presence_penalty=0.3, and queued at position 3"
);
```
‚úÖ **CORRECT**: ‚â§100 characters
```rust
narrate_info!(
    human = "Accepted request; queued at position 3 (ETA 420 ms) on pool 'default'",
    model_ref = "llama-7b",
    max_tokens = 150,
    // Other params as structured fields, not in human!
   - More cute story examples
   - Anti-pattern warnings
