## Known Issues

### 1. Flaky Test (NARR-7004)
**Test**: `test_narrate_auto_respects_existing_fields`  
**Status**: Passes individually, fails in suite  
**Root Cause**: `CaptureAdapter` global state corruption  
**Mitigation**: Annotated with `#[serial(capture_adapter)]`  
**Fix Needed**: Refactor to thread-local storage

### 2. Redaction Performance (NARR-5005, NARR-5006)
**Issue**: Redaction takes ~180ms for 200-char strings  
**Target**: <1μs for clean strings, <5μs with secrets  
**Current**: ~180ms (36,000x slower than target!)  
**Impact**: High - affects all narration events  
**Fix Needed**: Optimize regex patterns or use different approach

## Progress vs. Audit Findings

### VIOLATION #1: Flaky Tests (MEDIUM)
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL FIX**
- ✅ Added `serial_test` dependency
- ✅ Annotated tests with `#[serial(capture_adapter)]`
- ✅ Added cleanup delays
- ❌ Tests still flaky when run together
- **Next**: Refactor `CaptureAdapter` to thread-local storage

### VIOLATION #2: Insufficient Test Coverage (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED**
- ✅ Added 9 new property tests
- ✅ Improved coverage from 41 to 50 tests
- ✅ Pass rate improved from 70% to 98%
- ⏳ Integration tests pending
- **Next**: Fix integration tests, apply `#[serial]`

### VIOLATION #3: Missing Proof Bundle Integration (HIGH)
**Status**: ❌ **NOT STARTED**
- ❌ No proof bundle integration
- ❌ Tests don't emit artifacts
- **Next**: Add `proof-bundle` dependency, integrate in tests

### VIOLATION #4: Missing Specification (HIGH)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Created `.specs/00_narration-core.md`
- ✅ Documented 42 normative requirements
- ✅ Created verification plan
- ✅ Tests reference requirement IDs
- **Done**: Specification complete

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Fix `CaptureAdapter` global state**
   - Refactor to use thread-local storage
   - Or create test-scoped adapters
   - Estimated effort: 6 hours

2. **Optimize redaction performance**
   - Current: ~180ms for 200 chars
   - Target: <5μs for 200 chars
   - This is a 36,000x performance gap!
   - Estimated effort: 8 hours

3. **Add proof bundle integration**
   - Follow remediation plan Task 2.1-2.4
   - Estimated effort: 15 hours

### Short-term (Next Sprint)

4. **Fix integration tests**
   - Apply `#[serial]` to all integration tests
   - Verify they pass
   - Estimated effort: 4 hours

5. **Run BDD tests**
   - Execute BDD suite
   - Fix any failures
   - Estimated effort: 4 hours

## Success Metrics

### Test Coverage
- **Before**: 41 tests, 70% passing
- **After**: 50 tests, 98% passing
- **Improvement**: +9 tests, +28% pass rate

### Specification
- **Before**: No specification
- **After**: 42 normative requirements documented
- **Improvement**: 100% specification coverage

### Compliance
- **Before**: 4/8 standards met (50%)
- **After**: 5/8 standards met, 2 partial (62.5%)
- **Improvement**: +12.5% compliance

## Conclusion

**Significant progress made**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive specification (42 requirements)
- ✅ Added 9 new property tests (all passing)
- ✅ Improved test pass rate from 70% to 98%
- ✅ Documented all known issues

**Critical issues remaining**:
- ❌ Flaky test (CaptureAdapter global state)
- ❌ Redaction performance (36,000x slower than target)
- ❌ No proof bundle integration

**Recommendation**: Address redaction performance issue before production use. This is a critical performance bottleneck that affects all narration events.
