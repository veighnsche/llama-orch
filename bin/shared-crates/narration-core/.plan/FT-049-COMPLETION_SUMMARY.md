## What We Delivered

### 1. Extended Taxonomy (`src/lib.rs`)

Added worker-specific constants:

**Actors**:
- `ACTOR_WORKER_ORCD` — Worker daemon
- `ACTOR_INFERENCE_ENGINE` — Inference engine
- `ACTOR_VRAM_RESIDENCY` — VRAM manager

**Actions**:
- `ACTION_INFERENCE_START` — Inference start
- `ACTION_INFERENCE_COMPLETE` — Inference complete
- `ACTION_HEARTBEAT_SEND` — Heartbeat send
- `ACTION_READY_CALLBACK` — Ready callback
- `ACTION_CANCEL` — Cancellation
- Plus VRAM and pool management actions

### 2. Integration Guide (`docs/WORKER_ORCD_INTEGRATION.md`)

Complete step-by-step guide with:
- Dependency setup
- Correlation ID extraction
- Critical path narrations
- Editorial guidelines
- Testing examples
- Verification commands
- Complete code examples

### 3. BDD Scenarios (`bdd/features/worker_orcd_integration.feature`)

25 scenarios covering:
- Correlation ID propagation
- Performance metrics
- Editorial standards
- Error context quality
- Secret redaction
- Distributed tracing

### 4. Planning Documents

- `.plan/FT-049-worker-orcd-integration.md` — Our perspective on the story
- `.plan/PM_MISSED_ANALYSIS.md` — Root cause analysis of what PM missed
- `.plan/FT-049-COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` — This document

### 5. Handoff Document

- `bin/worker-orcd/.plan/foundation-team/stories/FT-041-to-FT-050/FT-049-NARRATION_CORE_HANDOFF.md`
- Ready-to-use guide for worker-orcd team

### 6. Updated README

- Added "Integration Guides" section
- Linked to worker-orcd guide
- Placeholder for future guides

## What PM Missed

The PM wrote FT-049 as if Foundation-Alpha needs to "integrate narration-core logging patterns" internally. But:

1. **We ARE narration-core** — We don't integrate with ourselves
2. **Provider/consumer split** — Story should have been split into two perspectives
3. **No dependency spec** — How does worker-orcd add the dependency?
4. **No taxonomy** — Do we provide worker-specific actors/actions?
5. **No integration guide** — How does worker-orcd actually use us?
6. **No BDD scenarios** — How do we verify correct usage?
7. **No editorial process** — Who reviews narration quality?
8. **No correlation ID spec** — How do IDs propagate across services?

We fixed all of these. See `.plan/PM_MISSED_ANALYSIS.md` for full analysis.

## Next Steps

### Worker-Orcd Team (Day 74)

1. ⏳ Read integration guide
2. ⏳ Add dependency to `Cargo.toml`
3. ⏳ Import taxonomy constants
4. ⏳ Extract correlation IDs from HTTP headers
5. ⏳ Emit narration at critical paths
6. ⏳ Propagate correlation IDs in outgoing requests
7. ⏳ Write unit tests
8. ⏳ Submit for editorial review

### Narration-Core Team (Day 74)

1. ✅ Deliverables complete
2. ⏳ Monitor worker-orcd integration
3. ⏳ Conduct editorial review
4. ⏳ Provide feedback
5. ⏳ Approve narration quality

---

## Success Metrics

### Narration-Core

- ✅ Integration guide published
- ✅ BDD scenarios written (25 scenarios)
- ✅ Taxonomy extended (5 actors, 15+ actions)
- ⏳ Worker-orcd successfully integrated
- ⏳ Editorial review completed

### Worker-Orcd

- ⏳ Dependency added
- ⏳ All critical paths emit narration
- ⏳ Correlation IDs propagated
- ⏳ Performance metrics included
- ⏳ Editorial review passed

### Project

- ⏳ Distributed tracing works end-to-end
- ⏳ Correlation IDs traceable across services
- ⏳ Debugging is delightful

---

## Build Verification

```bash
$ cargo fmt --package observability-narration-core
✅ Success

$ cargo check --package observability-narration-core
✅ Success (2 dead code warnings, expected)
```

## Lessons Learned

### For PMs

1. **Identify provider vs. consumer** — Library integration requires two perspectives
2. **Write two stories** — One for provider, one for consumer
3. **Integration guides are deliverables** — Not just code
4. **Editorial review is work** — For narration-core, review is a deliverable

### For Narration-Core

1. **We're a service provider** — Our job is to make integration easy
2. **Guides are as important as code** — Prevent misuse
3. **BDD tests verify integration** — Not just our code, but consumer patterns
4. **Editorial authority is real** — We review and approve narration quality
