Feature: Story Mode Behaviors
  As a developer using narration-core
  I want dialogue-focused story narration
  So that I can understand conversations between components

  Background:
    Given a clean capture adapter

    Then the captured narration has no story field

  Scenario: B-STORY-003 - Story field supports dialogue
    When I narrate with story "\"Do you have capacity?\" asked orchestratord. \"Yes!\" replied pool-managerd."
