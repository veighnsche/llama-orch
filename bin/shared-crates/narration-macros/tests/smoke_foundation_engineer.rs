//! Smoke test: Foundation engineers can use macros out-of-the-box.
//!
//! This test verifies that a foundation engineer can:
//! - Import and use #[narrate(...)] macro
//! - Import and use #[trace_fn] macro
//! - Have actor auto-inferred from module path
//! - Use template interpolation
//! - Support async functions
//! - Support Result types
