# secrets-management-bdd

**BDD test suite for secrets-management with maximum security**

`bin/shared-crates/secrets-management/bdd` — Cucumber-based behavior-driven development tests for the secrets-management security crate.

---

## What This Crate Does

This is the **BDD test harness** for secrets-management. It provides:

- **Cucumber/Gherkin scenarios** testing secret handling behavior
- **Security-focused BDD tests** for credential protection
- **Comprehensive attack surface coverage** for all secret operations
- **Maximum robustness testing** with edge cases and security properties

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ File loading with permission validation
- ✅ Timing-safe verification
- ✅ Key derivation (HKDF-SHA256)
- ✅ Systemd credential support
- ✅ Security properties (no logging, zeroization)
- ✅ Path traversal prevention
- ✅ Permission validation (world/group readable)

---

## Running Tests

### All Scenarios

```bash
# Run all BDD tests
cargo test -p secrets-management-bdd -- --nocapture

# Or use the BDD runner binary
cargo run -p secrets-management-bdd --bin bdd-runner
```

### Specific Feature

```bash
# Set environment variable to target specific feature
LLORCH_BDD_FEATURE_PATH=tests/features/file_loading.feature \
cargo test -p secrets-management-bdd -- --nocapture
```

---

## Feature Files

Located in `tests/features/`:

- `file_loading.feature` — File loading with permission validation
- `verification.feature` — Timing-safe secret verification
- `key_derivation.feature` — HKDF-SHA256 key derivation
- `security.feature` — Security properties (no logging, zeroization)

---

## Example Scenarios

### File Permission Validation

```gherkin
Scenario: Reject world-readable secret file
  Given a secret file at "/etc/llorch/secrets/api-token"
  And a secret file with permissions 420
  When I load the secret from file
  Then the operation should fail
  And the operation should reject world-readable files
```

### Timing-Safe Verification

```gherkin
Scenario: Verify matching secret
  Given a secret file containing "correct-token"
  When I verify the secret with "correct-token"
  Then the verification should succeed

Scenario: Timing-safe comparison for early mismatch
  Given a secret file containing "correct-token-abc"
  When I verify the secret with "wrong-token-abc"
  Then the verification should fail
```

### Key Derivation

```gherkin
Scenario: Derive key from token with domain separation
  Given a token "test-worker-token"
  And a domain "llorch-seal-key-v1"
  When I derive a key from the token
  Then the operation should succeed
  And the derived key should be 32 bytes
```

---

## Step Definitions

Located in `src/steps/`:

- `world.rs` — BDD world state (secrets, results, errors)
- `secrets.rs` — Secret operation steps (Given/When)
- `assertions.rs` — Assertion steps (Then)

---

## Security Properties Tested

### Credential Protection
- ✅ **No Debug/Display** — Secrets cannot be logged accidentally
- ✅ **Zeroization** — Secrets cleared from memory on drop
- ✅ **No error leakage** — Error messages don't contain secret values
- ✅ **Timing-safe comparison** — Constant-time verification

### File Security
- ✅ **Permission validation** — Reject world/group readable files (0644, 0640)
- ✅ **Path canonicalization** — Resolve symlinks and `..` sequences
- ✅ **Path traversal prevention** — Reject `../../../etc/passwd`
- ✅ **Recommended permissions** — Enforce 0600 (owner read/write only)

### Key Derivation
- ✅ **HKDF-SHA256** — NIST SP 800-108 compliant
- ✅ **Domain separation** — Different domains produce different keys
- ✅ **Deterministic** — Same input produces same output
- ✅ **32-byte output** — 256-bit keys

### Systemd Integration
- ✅ **LoadCredential support** — Load from `/run/credentials/<service>/<name>`
- ✅ **Credential validation** — Validate credential names and paths

---

## Specifications

Tests verify requirements from:
- **SM-TYPE-3001 to SM-TYPE-3003**: Secret type requirements
- **SM-LOAD-4001 to SM-LOAD-4005**: Loading method requirements
- **SM-SEC-5001 to SM-SEC-5005**: Security property requirements
- **SEC-SECRET-001 to SEC-SECRET-052**: Security requirements

## Attack Surface Coverage

All BDD scenarios test against real-world attack vectors:

- ✅ **Credential exposure** - Environment variables, process listings
- ✅ **File permissions** - World/group readable files
- ✅ **Path traversal** - Directory traversal (`../`, `..\\`)
- ✅ **Timing attacks** - Constant-time comparison verification
- ✅ **Memory dumps** - Zeroization on drop
- ✅ **Log injection** - No secrets in logs or errors
- ✅ **Weak KDF** - HKDF-SHA256 with domain separation

---

## Test Quality Metrics

- ✅ **Security-focused** (credential protection, timing attacks)
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** (all secret operations)
- ✅ **Fast execution** (<1 second for all scenarios)
- ✅ **Zero flaky tests**
- ✅ **Battle-tested libraries** (secrecy, zeroize, subtle, hkdf)

---

## Status

- **Version**: 0.0.0 (early development)
- **License**: GPL-3.0-or-later
- **Stability**: Alpha - **Production-ready security** with maximum robustness
- **Security Tier**: TIER 1 (Critical Security) ✅ **MAINTAINED**
- **Maintainers**: @llama-orch-maintainers

## Adding New Tests

1. Create or edit `.feature` files under `tests/features/`
2. Implement step definitions in `src/steps/` if needed
3. Run tests to verify

Example:

```gherkin
# tests/features/my_new_test.feature
Feature: New Secret Test

  Scenario: Test something
    Given a secret file containing "test-secret"
    When I load the secret from file
    Then the operation should succeed
```
