# Security Policy

- Please report vulnerabilities privately via security@localhost.example.
- Do not open public issues for security reports.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.

For guidance on optional, home-lab-friendly authentication posture (no enterprise features), see `.specs/11_min_auth_hooks.md` â€” a Draft SPEC proposing minimal auth hooks (Bearer token seam, loopback posture, proxy trust toggle). This SPEC is documentation-only and does not change runtime behavior by itself.
