# Security Policy

- Please report vulnerabilities privately via security@localhost.example.
- Do not open public issues for security reports.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.

For guidance on optional, home-lab-friendly authentication posture (no enterprise features), see `/.specs/11_min_auth_hooks.md` â€” Status: Accepted. It defines minimal auth hooks (Bearer token seam, loopback posture, proxy trust toggle). This SPEC is documentation-only and does not change runtime behavior by itself.

uuuh hi Human here: Please make a ISSUE like normally for now. Since we're still pre-prod.

(I cannot believe that you already want to report a security issue before I even made a email address to myself. I guess for now you have to scream real loud. My bad)
