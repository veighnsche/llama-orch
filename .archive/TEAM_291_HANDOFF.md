# TEAM-291 Handoff: Fixed `./rbee hive start` and Added Comprehensive Error Handling

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Mission:** Fix rbee-hive startup failure and add production-grade error handling

---

## Summary

Successfully fixed TEAM-290's reported issue where `./rbee hive start` spawned a process that immediately crashed. Root cause was Axum 0.7 routing syntax incompatibility. Added comprehensive error handling throughout hive-lifecycle crate with crash detection, stderr capture, and graceful shutdown patterns.

**Key Results:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed Axum routing panic (`:job_id` ‚Üí `{job_id}`)
- ‚úÖ Added crash detection with stderr capture
- ‚úÖ Added HTTP health verification
- ‚úÖ Added graceful shutdown (SIGTERM ‚Üí wait ‚Üí SIGKILL)
- ‚úÖ Full workflow tested and working

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Axum Routing Panic ‚úÖ

**File:** `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs:92`

**Problem:** 
```rust
.route("/v1/jobs/:job_id/stream", get(http::jobs::handle_stream_job))
```

**Error:**
```
thread 'main' panicked at bin/20_rbee_hive/src/main.rs:92:10:
Path segments must not start with `:`. For capture groups, use `{capture}`.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Axum 0.6 used `:param` syntax for path parameters
- Axum 0.7+ requires `{param}` syntax
- Old syntax causes panic during router creation (before HTTP server starts)

**Fix:**
```rust
.route("/v1/jobs/{job_id}/stream", get(http::jobs::handle_stream_job))
```

**Impact:** Hive now starts successfully without crashing

---

### 2. Enhanced Start Command with Crash Detection ‚úÖ

**File:** `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/start.rs`

**Problem:** Old code used `Stdio::null()` which hid all startup errors. If hive crashed, we never knew why.

**Solution:** Comprehensive startup verification (5 steps):

1. **Capture stderr to temp file** - Preserve crash diagnostics
2. **Spawn process and get PID** - Track the process
3. **Wait for startup (2 seconds)** - Give time to initialize
4. **Check if process crashed** - Use `child.try_wait()` to detect early exits
5. **Verify HTTP server responds** - Health check with 3-second timeout

**New Narration:**
```
[hive-strt ] start_hive_spawn: üöÄ Spawning hive from '/home/vince/.local/bin/rbee-hive'
[hive-strt ] start_hive_spawned: ‚úÖ Hive spawned with PID: 474187
[hive-strt ] start_hive_wait: ‚è≥ Waiting for hive to start (2 seconds)...
[hive-strt ] start_hive_alive: ‚úÖ Process still alive (PID: 474187)
[hive-strt ] start_hive_health_check: üè• Checking health endpoint: http://localhost:9000/health
[hive-strt ] start_hive_health_ok: ‚úÖ Health check passed
[hive-strt ] start_hive_complete: ‚úÖ Hive started at 'http://localhost:9000'
```

**Error Handling:**
- If process crashes: Shows stderr content with panic message
- If HTTP fails: Shows stderr content with connection error
- Cleans up stderr file on success

**Benefits:**
- Immediate feedback on startup failures
- Clear error messages with full context
- No silent failures

---

### 3. Graceful Shutdown Pattern ‚úÖ

**File:** `bin/05_rbee_keeper_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/stop.rs`

**Problem:** Old code used `pkill -f rbee-hive` which sends SIGTERM by default, but didn't verify graceful shutdown or force kill if needed.

**Solution:** 3-step graceful shutdown pattern (matches daemon-lifecycle):

1. **Send SIGTERM** - Request graceful shutdown
2. **Wait 5 seconds** - Give time for cleanup
3. **Force kill if needed** - SIGKILL if still running

**New Narration:**
```
[hive-stop ] stop_hive_sigterm: üì® Sending SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)...
[hive-stop ] stop_hive_wait : ‚è≥ Waiting for graceful shutdown (5 seconds)...
[hive-stop ] stop_hive_graceful_complete: ‚úÖ Hive stopped (graceful shutdown)
```

**Or if force kill needed:**
```
[hive-stop ] stop_hive_sigkill: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Graceful shutdown failed, sending SIGKILL (force)...
[hive-stop ] stop_hive_force_complete: ‚úÖ Hive stopped (force killed)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean shutdown preserves state
- Force kill ensures process always stops
- Clear feedback on shutdown method used

### ‚úÖ Follows Debugging Rules

**Bug Fix Documentation in `main.rs`:**
```rust
// ============================================================
// BUG FIX: TEAM-291 | Fixed Axum routing panic on startup
// ============================================================
// SUSPICION:
// - TEAM-290 reported hive crashes immediately after spawn
// - Error: "Path segments must not start with `:`. For capture groups, use `{capture}`"
//
// INVESTIGATION:
// - Checked Axum version in Cargo.toml - using 0.7.x
// - Found line 92 using old Axum 0.6 syntax `:job_id`
// - Axum 0.7+ requires new syntax `{job_id}`
//
// ROOT CAUSE:
// - Route pattern used old Axum 0.6 syntax (`:job_id`)
// - Axum 0.7+ requires curly braces (`{job_id}`)
// - This caused panic on router creation, before HTTP server started
//
// FIX:
// - Changed `:job_id` to `{job_id}` in route pattern
// - Now compatible with Axum 0.7+
//
// TESTING:
// - ./rbee hive start - SUCCESS (no crash)
// - pgrep -f rbee-hive - SUCCESS (process running)
// - curl http://localhost:9000/health - SUCCESS (returns "ok")
// ============================================================
```

## Architecture Improvements

### Before (TEAM-290)

```
./rbee hive start
  ‚Üì
spawn rbee-hive with Stdio::null()
  ‚Üì
wait 2 seconds
  ‚Üì
check if process exists (pgrep)
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Report success (even if crashed!)
```

**Problems:**
- No stderr capture - can't see why it crashed
- No crash detection - reports success even if process exited
- No HTTP verification - can't tell if server actually started
- Silent failures - user has no idea what went wrong

### After (TEAM-291)

```
./rbee hive start
  ‚Üì
spawn rbee-hive with stderr ‚Üí temp file
  ‚Üì
wait 2 seconds
  ‚Üì
check if process crashed (child.try_wait())
  ‚îú‚îÄ If crashed: show stderr with panic message
  ‚îî‚îÄ If alive: continue
  ‚Üì
verify HTTP server responds (health check)
  ‚îú‚îÄ If fails: show stderr with connection error
  ‚îî‚îÄ If success: clean up temp file
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Report success (verified working!)
```

**Benefits:**
- Immediate crash detection with full error context
- HTTP verification ensures server actually started
- Clear error messages guide user to fix
- No silent failures

## Narration Quality

### Comprehensive User Feedback

**Start Command (7 narration events):**
1. `start_hive` - Starting on host
2. `start_hive_local` - Local vs remote
3. `start_hive_spawn` - Binary path
4. `start_hive_spawned` - PID
5. `start_hive_wait` - Waiting for startup
6. `start_hive_alive` - Process still running
7. `start_hive_health_check` - HTTP verification
8. `start_hive_health_ok` - Health check passed
9. `start_hive_complete` - Final success

**Stop Command (4-6 narration events):**
1. `stop_hive` - Stopping on host
2. `stop_hive_local` - Local vs remote
3. `stop_hive_sigterm` - Sending SIGTERM
4. `stop_hive_wait` - Waiting for graceful shutdown
5. `stop_hive_graceful_complete` - Graceful success
   OR
6. `stop_hive_sigkill` - Force kill needed
7. `stop_hive_force_complete` - Force kill success

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

These are **NOT required** - the system is fully working. Future teams may consider:

### Priority 1: Remote Operations (Optional)

Currently only local operations are tested. Remote operations (SSH) should work but haven't been verified.

**Test:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.ssh/config:
Host gpu-server
  HostName 192.168.1.100
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Test remote operations
./rbee hive install --host gpu-server --binary ./target/debug/rbee-hive
./rbee hive start --host gpu-server
./rbee hive stop --host gpu-server
```

### Priority 2: Timeout Configuration (Optional)

Currently hardcoded timeouts:
- Startup wait: 2 seconds
- Health check: 3 seconds
- Graceful shutdown: 5 seconds

Could be made configurable via CLI args or env vars.

### Priority 3: Retry Logic (Optional)

Health check could retry 2-3 times before failing, in case server is slow to start.

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Mission complete:** `./rbee hive start` now works reliably  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling** added throughout hive-lifecycle  
‚úÖ **Production-ready** with crash detection and graceful shutdown
