# TEAM-334: rbee-hive Build Ready for Remote Installation

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Date:** Oct 27, 2025

## Summary

Successfully removed `worker-lifecycle` crate and prepared `rbee-hive` for remote installation testing.

## Key Architecture Clarification

### Worker Binary Management

**IMPORTANT:** Hive does NOT manage worker binaries - only worker PROCESSES!

```text
Worker Binary Management (NOT hive's job):
    ‚Üì
worker-catalog
    - Manages catalog of available worker binaries
    - Handles installation/uninstallation
    - Supports unlimited worker types:
      ‚Ä¢ cpu-llm-worker-rbee
      ‚Ä¢ cuda-llm-worker-rbee
      ‚Ä¢ metal-llm-worker-rbee
      ‚Ä¢ vulkan-llm-worker-rbee (future)
      ‚Ä¢ rocm-llm-worker-rbee (future)
      ‚Ä¢ etc.

Worker Process Management (hive's job):
    ‚Üì
rbee-hive
    - Spawns worker processes (assumes binary exists)
    - Lists running processes (ps)
    - Stops processes (kill)
```

### Comments Added

Added comprehensive comments in `job_router.rs` explaining:

1. **Worker Operations Section** (lines 131-146)
   - Worker lifecycle uses daemon-lifecycle directly
   - Worker binary install/uninstall is NOT handled by hive
   - Worker binaries are managed by worker-catalog
   - Hive only spawns/stops worker PROCESSES
   - There are unlimited types of workers

2. **Worker Binary Management Section** (lines 213-238)
   - Worker binary installation/uninstallation responsibility
   - worker-catalog manages the catalog
   - queen-rbee's PackageSync distributes binaries
   - List of worker types (cpu, cuda, metal, vulkan, rocm, etc.)
   - Binary lifecycle: Build ‚Üí Add to catalog ‚Üí Distribute

3. **Inline Comments**
   - Worker type determination assumes binary exists
   - Binary lookup errors explain catalog is responsible
   - Clear error messages guide users to worker-catalog

## Build Status

```bash
‚úÖ cargo build -p rbee-hive
‚úÖ Binary created: target/debug/rbee-hive (135M)
‚úÖ Ready for remote installation testing
```

## What Was Done

1. ‚úÖ **Removed** worker-lifecycle crate entirely
2. ‚úÖ **Wired** daemon-lifecycle directly into rbee-hive
3. ‚úÖ **Added** comprehensive comments about worker binary management
4. ‚úÖ **Verified** successful build
5. ‚úÖ **Ready** for remote installation testing

## Remote Installation Testing

The `rbee-hive` binary is now ready to be installed remotely using:

```bash
# From rbee-keeper
rbee-keeper hive install -a workstation

# This will use daemon-lifecycle to:
# 1. Copy target/debug/rbee-hive to remote host via SCP
# 2. Install to ~/.local/bin/rbee-hive
# 3. Make executable
```

## Worker Binary Management Flow

```text
1. Build worker binary:
   cargo build -p cpu-llm-worker-rbee

2. Add to worker-catalog:
   worker-catalog add cpu-llm-worker-rbee

3. Distribute to hives (via PackageSync):
   queen-rbee ‚Üí PackageSync ‚Üí hive (SCP)

4. Spawn worker process (hive's job):
   rbee-hive ‚Üí daemon-lifecycle ‚Üí start_daemon()
```

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs`
  - Added worker operations section comment (15 lines)
  - Added worker binary management section comment (26 lines)
  - Added inline comments explaining catalog responsibility

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test remote installation** - Use `rbee-keeper hive install -a workstation`
2. ‚è≥ **Test remote start** - Use `rbee-keeper hive start -a workstation`
3. ‚è≥ **Test remote stop** - Use `rbee-keeper hive stop -a workstation`
4. ‚è≥ **Verify SSH config** - Ensure `~/.ssh/config` has workstation entry

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hive manages PROCESSES, not BINARIES**
2. **worker-catalog manages BINARIES**
3. **Unlimited worker types supported**
4. **Each worker type is a separate binary**
5. **Build is successful and ready for testing**

**rbee-hive is now ready for remote installation testing!** üöÄ
