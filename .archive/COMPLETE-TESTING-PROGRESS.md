## Critical Invariants Verified

### ‚úÖ Verified (12 invariants)
1. **job_id MUST propagate** - SSE routing works
2. **[DONE] marker MUST be sent** - Completion detection works
3. **Stdio::null() MUST be used** - E2E tests don't hang
4. **Timeouts MUST fire** - No infinite hangs
5. **Channels MUST be cleaned up** - No memory leaks
6. **SSH agent MUST be running** - Pre-flight checks work
7. **Binary resolution MUST follow priority** - Correct binary found
8. **Health polling MUST use exponential backoff** - Efficient polling
9. **Config MUST handle concurrent access** - No corruption
10. **Heartbeat MUST detect staleness** - Stale detection works
11. **Narration MUST handle unicode** - No garbled output
12. **Cache MUST detect staleness** - Performance optimization

### ‚è≥ Remaining (3 invariants)
13. Error messages MUST be helpful
14. Resource cleanup MUST happen on disconnect
15. Integration flows MUST work end-to-end
