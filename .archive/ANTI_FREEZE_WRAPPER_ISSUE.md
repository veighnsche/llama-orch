# Anti-Freeze Wrapper Issue

**⚠️ STATUS: SUPERSEDED**

This document describes a **failed approach** that tried to show live output while buffering.

**✅ CURRENT SOLUTION:** See `ANTI_FREEZE_ENFORCER_SOLUTION.md`

The new approach **refuses to work in pipeline mode** instead of trying to show live output. This is sustainable and works in Cascade's environment.

---

## Objective (Original Failed Approach)
Create wrapper scripts for `grep`, `head`, and `tail` that:
1. Show ALL input live to the user's terminal (anti-freeze protocol)
2. Still filter the pipeline output correctly
3. Work transparently - commands look and behave the same

## What Was Implemented

### Files Created
- `/home/vince/.local/bin/grep` - grep wrapper script
- `/home/vince/.local/bin/head` - head wrapper script  
- `/home/vince/.local/bin/tail` - tail wrapper script

### PATH Configuration
- `~/.local/bin` is prepended to PATH in `~/.bashrc`
- `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

### Wrapper Behavior
All three wrappers follow the same pattern:
1. If output is to TTY (not a pipeline), use real command
2. If arguments include files, use real command
3. In pipeline mode:
   - Buffer all input to temp file
   - Use `tee` to duplicate input to terminal
   - Apply real command to buffered content
   - Return filtered results to pipeline

### Current Implementation Details

**grep wrapper** (lines 34-42):
```bash
ttydev="/dev/pts/8"
if [[ -w "$ttydev" ]]; then
  tee "$tmp" >"$ttydev"
else
  tee "$tmp" >&2
fi
```

**head wrapper** (lines 29-30):
```bash
tee "$tmp" >&2
```

**tail wrapper** (lines 29-30):
```bash
tee "$tmp" >&2
```

## Test Results

### Wrapper Activation
✅ Wrappers are correctly installed and found in PATH:
```bash
$ which grep
/home/vince/.local/bin/grep

$ grep --wrapper-test
WRAPPER IS ACTIVE - Anti-freeze protocol enabled
```

### Pipeline Execution
✅ Wrappers execute in pipeline mode
✅ Filtering works correctly
✅ `tee` command runs successfully
❌ Live output does NOT appear in terminal

### Test Commands Run
```bash
# Test 1: Simple grep
(for i in {1..5}; do echo "Line $i"; sleep 0.5; done) 2>&1 | grep "Line 3"
Result: Only shows "Line 3" at end, no live output

# Test 2: With debug output
echo "test" | bash -x ~/.local/bin/grep test 2>&1
Result: Shows wrapper execution, tee runs, but live output not visible separately

# Test 3: Direct TTY write
tee writes to /dev/pts/8 directly
Result: No live output visible
```

## What Works
- ✅ Wrapper scripts are executable and in PATH
- ✅ Wrappers correctly detect pipeline vs TTY mode
- ✅ Wrappers correctly detect file vs stdin input
- ✅ `tee` command executes without errors
- ✅ Temp files are created and cleaned up
- ✅ Filtering produces correct final output
- ✅ Exit codes are correct

## What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Live output does NOT appear in user's terminal during execution
- ❌ User only sees final filtered result, not the streaming input
- ❌ Writing to stderr (`>&2`) does not show live output
- ❌ Writing to TTY device (`>/dev/pts/8`) does not show live output

## Environment
- Shell: bash
- Terminal: Cascade IDE terminal
- TTY: `/dev/pts/8`
- OS: Linux (Arch-based)

## Expected Behavior
When running: `(sleep 1; echo "A"; sleep 1; echo "B"; sleep 1; echo "C") | grep B`

User should see:
1. (1 second wait)
2. "A" appears
3. (1 second wait)  
4. "B" appears
5. (1 second wait)
6. "C" appears
7. Final output: "B"

## Actual Behavior
User sees:
1. (3 second wait)
2. Final output: "B"

No intermediate output is visible.

## Files to Review
- `/home/vince/.local/bin/grep` (47 lines)
- `/home/vince/.local/bin/head` (39 lines)
- `/home/vince/.local/bin/tail` (39 lines)
- `/home/vince/.bashrc` (PATH configuration)
