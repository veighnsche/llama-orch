---

## Executive Summary

Beyond TEAM-244's 125 tests, there are **150+ additional high-priority testing opportunities** across:
1. **Graceful Shutdown** (hive-lifecycle) - 8 tests
2. **Capabilities Cache** (hive-lifecycle) - 12 tests
3. **Error Propagation** (all boundaries) - 35 tests
4. **Job Router Operations** (queen-rbee) - 25 tests
5. **Hive Registry Edge Cases** - 20 tests
6. **Job Registry Edge Cases** - 20 tests
7. **Narration Routing** (job_id isolation) - 15 tests
8. **Integration Flows** (keeper↔queen↔hive) - 40 tests

**Total: 175+ additional tests, 60-90 days effort**

---

## 1. Graceful Shutdown Tests (CRITICAL)

**File:** `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/stop.rs` (lines 1-179)  
**Current Coverage:** ~20%  
**Priority:** HIGH (user-facing operation)

### Missing Tests (8 tests)

#### SIGTERM Behavior (3 tests)
- [ ] Test SIGTERM success (process exits within 5s)
- [ ] Test SIGTERM timeout → SIGKILL fallback
- [ ] Test process already stopped (idempotent)

**Why Critical:**
```rust
// TEAM-212: Graceful shutdown (stop.rs:108-162)
tokio::process::Command::new("pkill")
    .args(&["-TERM", binary_name])
    .output()
    .await?;

// If SIGTERM fails, must SIGKILL (line 159)
tokio::process::Command::new("pkill")
    .args(&["-KILL", binary_name])
    .output()
    .await?;
```

Without tests, we don't know if:
- SIGTERM is actually sent
- Timeout is respected (5s)
- SIGKILL fallback works
- Idempotency is maintained

#### Health Check During Shutdown (2 tests)
- [ ] Test health check polling during shutdown (1s intervals)
- [ ] Test early exit when health check fails

#### Error Handling (3 tests)
- [ ] Test pkill command not found
- [ ] Test permission denied (non-root user)
- [ ] Test process name collision (multiple processes with same name)

---

## 2. Capabilities Cache Tests (CRITICAL)

**File:** `bin/15_queen_rbee_crates/hive-lifecycle/src/start.rs` (lines 79, 121)  
**Current Coverage:** ~10%  
**Priority:** HIGH (performance critical)

### Missing Tests (12 tests)

#### Cache Hit/Miss (4 tests)
- [ ] Test cache hit (return cached, suggest refresh)
- [ ] Test cache miss (fetch fresh, update cache)
- [ ] Test cache refresh (force fetch, update cache)
- [ ] Test cache cleanup on uninstall

**Why Critical:**
```rust
// TEAM-212: Capabilities caching (start.rs:79, 121)
// Step 5: Fetch and cache capabilities
return fetch_and_cache_capabilities(alias, &hive_config, &config, job_id).await;

// Without tests, we don't know if:
// - Cache is actually used (performance regression)
// - Cache is properly invalidated
// - Stale cache causes incorrect scheduling
```

#### Staleness Detection (3 tests)
- [ ] Test cache staleness detection (>24h)
- [ ] Test cache with corrupted file
- [ ] Test cache with missing file

#### Concurrent Access (3 tests)

---

## 3. Error Propagation Tests (CRITICAL)

- [ ] Test hive alias not in config
- [ ] Test helpful error message with available hives
- [ ] Test localhost special case (always available)
- [ ] Test auto-generation of template hives.conf
- [ ] Test error message includes actionable advice

**Why Critical:**
```rust
// TEAM-215: Error handling in job_router.rs (line 208)
let hive_config = validate_hive_exists(&state.config, &alias)?;

// Without tests, users get cryptic errors like:
// "Hive alias 'remote' not found in hives.conf"
// Instead of helpful message with available hives
```

## Quick Reference: What to Test

### Graceful Shutdown (stop.rs)
```rust
// SIGTERM → wait 5s → SIGKILL
// Test: Does SIGTERM actually work?
// Test: Does timeout trigger SIGKILL?
// Test: Is it idempotent?
```

### Capabilities Cache
```rust
// Cache hit/miss/refresh
// Test: Is cache actually used?
// Test: Is cache invalidated?
// Test: Does stale cache cause issues?
```

### Error Propagation
```rust
// All errors should have actionable messages
// Test: Does user know what went wrong?
// Test: Does user know how to fix it?
// Test: Are errors consistent?
```

### Job Router Operations
```rust
// Status, SSH test, hive list/get/status
// Test: Do operations work?
// Test: Do operations handle errors?
// Test: Are results formatted correctly?
```

### Integration Flows
```rust
// keeper → queen → hive → queen → keeper
// Test: Does data flow correctly?
// Test: Do errors propagate?
// Test: Are jobs cleaned up?
```

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Phase 1** (Graceful Shutdown, Capabilities Cache, Error Propagation)
