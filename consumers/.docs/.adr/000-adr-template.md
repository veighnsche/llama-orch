# NNN-ADR: *Decision Title*
## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded by NNN-ADR
## Context
* What problem or gap in the **library design** does this address?
* Why is the decision required now?
* Which backend capabilities (tasks, sessions, artifacts, placement, determinism) are relevant?
* What constraints apply (Rust safety, SafeFs sandbox,  requirements, determinism guarantees, etc.)?
## Decision (RFC-2119)
This section states the decision using **RFC-2119 terms** so it is enforceable in code and specs:
* The library **MUST** …
* Applets **SHOULD** …
* Processes **MAY** …
* The runner **MUST NOT** …
## Consequences
* **Positive:** Expected benefits (safety, reproducibility, composability).
* **Negative:** Risks, costs, technical debt, or added complexity.
* **Trade-offs:** Design compromises consciously accepted.
## Alternatives Considered
* Option A: summary + why rejected
* Option B: summary + why rejected
* Option C: summary + why rejected
## Artifacts / Proof Bundle Links
* Relevant demo processes, JSONL traces, or  manifests.
* Regression tests, golden fixtures, or BDD scenarios that validate the decision.
## References
* Related ADRs, specs, or proposals.
* Backend API docs (tasks, sessions, artifacts, placement).
* External influences (Ollama, LangChain, etc.).
