# Identity

_Source: `consumers/.business/ondernemersplan_NL_nl/.002-draft/identity.md`_

## Core Identity
- Role: independent tradesman for AI plumbing.
- Archetype: like a plumber/electrician, but for AI systems.
- Scope: local-first, global OSS impact.
- Form: sole proprietor, not a corporate consultancy.

## Branding Metaphor
- Plumbing is invisible infrastructure until it fails.
- Vince installs, tests, and certifies the AI pipes and valves.

## Traits
- Independent, craftsman, transparent, proof-oriented, pragmatic.

## Tone of Voice
- Plainspoken, direct, no fluff.
- Technical but accessible; explain AI like water/electricity.
- Avoid hype; use precise, service-like phrasing.

## Positioning
- Against hype and black-box SaaS; pro open-source and control.
- Market: local orgs needing trustworthy AI infra without building from scratch.

## Service Levels (Menu)
- Level 0 — DIY / OSS Edition (GPL, no SLA).
- Level 1 — Shared Agentic API (Public Tap; prepaid credits; 12-month validity).
- Level 2 — Dedicated Agentic API (Private Tap; 1×/2×/4×/8× GPUs; optional OpenAI gateway).
- Level 3 — Custom Applications (toolkit-based bespoke work).

## Visual Cues
- Pipes/valves/gauges/blueprints; industrial neutrals with electric accents; clean sans-serif.

## Trust Signals
- Radical OSS posture, strong docs/tests, local presence, practical framing.

## Tagline Directions
- “AI plumbing, done right.”
- “Robust AI, without the leaks.”
- “I install and test your AI pipelines.”

## Elevator Pitch
> I’m Vince, your AI plumber. I build and maintain the pipelines that make agentic AI run as reliably as water or electricity. Everything I do is open, tested, and robust — so you can trust the flow.
