# Brand Guide

_Source: `consumers/.business/ondernemersplan_NL_nl/.002-draft/brand.md`_

## Brand Positioning
- **Archetype:** local tradesman (plumber/electrician) — practical, serious, reliable.
- **Primary audience:** IT teams in companies and agencies.
- **Secondary audience:** small businesses and OSS community.
- **Perception goal:** not a hypey innovator; the obvious, established trade of AI plumbing.

## Brand Traits
- Practical, no-nonsense.
- Proof-driven (logs, tests, certifications over slogans).
- Local and approachable (Vince forward).
- Blue-collar serious tone.
- Robust engineering (the plumbing just works).
- Responsibility and ongoing maintenance.

## Tone of Voice
- Direct, honest, practical; avoid hype.
- Emphasize robustness, completeness, and logs.
- Technical but clear (trusted by IT teams).

Examples:
- “Here’s your agentic API, plumbed correctly.”
- “All tests passed — proof included.”
- “Your pipeline health is my responsibility.”

## Visual Branding
- Imagery: stainless pipes, valves, gauges, blueprints; no abstract AI swirls.
- Style: industrial but clean; technical diagrams.
- Colors: industrial neutrals + cyan/purple/teal accents; accessible contrast.
- Typography: robust sans-serif (Inter, IBM Plex Sans, Source Sans); weighty headings.
- Layout: proofs first (logs, diagrams), boxed sections, blueprint grids.

## Messaging Principles
1. Show, don’t market (present proofs).
2. Infrastructure framing (pipes/valves/gauges).
3. Normal, not novel (a familiar trade).
4. Safe and performant (safety first, speed not hidden).
5. Personal branding (Vince’s identity as a trust signal).

## Tagline Directions
- “AI plumbing, done right.”
- “Robust AI, without the leaks.”
- “Your pipelines, tested and certified.”

## Differentiation
- From consultants: hands-on, tested infra.
- From startups: not hype-driven; local and approachable.
- From closed SaaS: open-source, inspectable plumbing.

## Usage Examples
- Home: Vince’s photo + tagline + blueprint pipes hero.
- Pricing: service menu (Level 0–3), not SaaS tiers.
- Reports/logs: electrician’s certificate style with results stamp.
