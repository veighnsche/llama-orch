# TEAM_RESPONSIBILITIES.md Refactoring Plan

## Problem Analysis

The current document is **fragmented and repetitive**. Characteristics are isolated in separate sections instead of blending naturally. The "Triple Mandate" reads like three separate personalities rather than one cohesive team.

### Key Issues

1. **Repetition**: Folder structure appears in 3 places, policy hunting in 4 places, code style in 2 places
2. **Isolation**: Each characteristic lives in its own bubble without cross-referencing
3. **Personality Split**: The team reads like 3 different teams instead of one unified voice
4. **Scattered Examples**: Code examples are duplicated and don't show the full picture
5. **Weak Integration**: "What We Own" sections don't connect to the philosophy or personality

---

## Refactoring Strategy

### Core Principle
**The Triple Mandate is not three separate jobs - it's three facets of one personality.**

The team is:
- **Readability-obsessed** (internal code)
- **Clarity-obsessed** (external API)
- **Policy-obsessed** (user empowerment)

These blend together in every action they take.

---

## New Structure

### 1. **Header & Mission** (Keep, enhance)
- Who we are (blend all three obsessions)
- Our mission (unified voice)
- Our personality (clumsy with words, clear with code, policy-obsessed)

### 2. **Our Character** (NEW - replaces "Triple Mandate")
Blend all characteristics into personality traits:

**We Are Readability Minimalists**
- Hate verbosity, love clarity
- Argue with ourselves (internal debate)
- 3-click rule for navigation
- Code speaks louder than words

**We Are Policy Hunters**
- Everything configurable should be configured
- Hunt hardcoded values like bugs
- Centralize in rbees-orcd/config.rs
- YAML, Rhai, env vars - user's choice

**We Are Style Enforcers**
- Own rustfmt.toml and .clippy.toml
- Zero warnings, zero exceptions
- Code style is developer experience

**We Are API Perfectionists**
- OpenAPI is sacred
- Every endpoint self-documenting
- External devs deserve beauty too

### 3. **Our Philosophy** (Consolidate & enhance)
Merge "Show Don't Tell", "Eternal Tension", "Rust Is Our Canvas", "OpenAPI Sacred"

**Show examples that demonstrate ALL characteristics at once**:
```rust
// Before: Verbose, hardcoded, unclear structure
const TIMEOUT: u64 = 5000;  // ← Should be policy!
fn handle_auth(...) { /* verbose mess */ }

// After: Clear, configurable, well-organized
// src/config.rs - Policy centralization
pub struct Config { timeout_ms: u64 }

// src/auth/bearer.rs - Clear structure, minimal code
fn handle_auth(req: &Request) -> Result<Token, AuthError> {
    parse_bearer(req.headers().get("authorization"))
}
```

### 4. **What We Own** (Consolidate, integrate personality)
Instead of 6 separate sections, organize by **impact area**:

**For Internal Developers**:
- Code refactoring (readability + structure + policy hunting)
- Style enforcement (rustfmt + clippy)
- Folder structure (3-click rule)

**For External Developers**:
- SDK crate (type-safe, ergonomic)
- OpenAPI contract (self-documenting)
- Examples (copy-paste ready)

**For All Users**:
- Policy system (YAML, Rhai, env vars)
- Configuration schema (rbees-orcd/config.rs)
- Documentation (code-heavy, word-light)

### 5. **How We Work** (Consolidate workflows)
Merge "Internal Refactoring Process" and "SDK Development Process" into one unified workflow that shows how all characteristics blend:

**Our Refactoring Workflow** (shows readability + policy + structure):
1. Audit: Find verbose code, hardcoded values, bad structure
2. Propose: Show before/after with ALL improvements
3. Review: Security, performance, correctness
4. Merge: Tests, docs, clippy, rustfmt - all green

### 6. **Our Relationships** (Keep, enhance)
Show how we collaborate with other teams using ALL our skills:
- auth-min: We make their security primitives ergonomic AND configurable
- Performance: We make their optimizations readable AND maintain clarity
- Testing: We make tests readable AND ensure policy coverage

### 7. **Our Standards** (Consolidate)
Merge "Perfectionists", "Humble", "Thorough" into one cohesive section showing the blend

### 8. **Practical Details** (Consolidate)
- Metrics (all characteristics measured)
- Current status
- Fun facts (blend all obsessions)
- Signature requirement

---

## Specific Consolidations

### Eliminate Repetition

**Folder Structure** (currently in 3 places):
- Keep ONE comprehensive example in "Our Character"
- Reference it elsewhere, don't repeat

**Policy Hunting** (currently in 4 places):
- Make it central to "We Are Policy Hunters"
- Show examples once, reference elsewhere

**Code Style** (currently in 2 places):
- Consolidate into "We Are Style Enforcers"
- Show rustfmt.toml and .clippy.toml once

**Refactoring Services** (currently scattered):
- Consolidate into "What We Provide"
- Show how each service uses ALL characteristics

### Blend Characteristics

**Example: Refactoring a crate**
Show how ONE refactor demonstrates:
- ✅ Improved readability (clear code)
- ✅ Better structure (3-click navigation)
- ✅ Policy extraction (hardcoded → config)
- ✅ Style enforcement (clippy clean)
- ✅ Type safety (enums not strings)

**Example: Building SDK**
Show how SDK work demonstrates:
- ✅ API clarity (OpenAPI first)
- ✅ Type safety (compile-time correctness)
- ✅ Ergonomics (builder patterns)
- ✅ Policy integration (configurable client)
- ✅ Documentation (code examples)

---

## New Section Order

1. **Header** - Who we are (unified personality)
2. **Our Character** - All traits blended (NEW)
3. **Our Philosophy** - How we think (consolidated)
4. **What We Own** - Organized by impact area (restructured)
5. **How We Work** - Unified workflow (consolidated)
6. **Our Relationships** - Collaboration patterns (enhanced)
7. **Our Standards** - Quality bar (consolidated)
8. **Practical Details** - Metrics, status, facts (consolidated)
9. **Signature** - Our mark (keep)

---

## Key Improvements

### Before (Current)
- 941 lines
- 6 "What We Own" sections (isolated)
- 3 separate mandates (personality split)
- Characteristics repeated 3-4 times
- Examples scattered and duplicated

### After (Target)
- ~600-700 lines (30% reduction)
- 3 "What We Own" areas (integrated)
- 1 unified character (personality blend)
- Each characteristic shown once, referenced elsewhere
- Examples demonstrate multiple traits simultaneously

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create new "Our Character" section** - Blend all personality traits
2. **Consolidate "Our Philosophy"** - Merge 4 subsections into 2
3. **Restructure "What We Own"** - 6 sections → 3 impact areas
4. **Merge workflows** - 2 processes → 1 unified approach
5. **Consolidate standards** - 3 subsections → 1 cohesive section
6. **Deduplicate examples** - Show each pattern once
7. **Cross-reference** - Link sections instead of repeating
8. **Final polish** - Ensure voice is consistent throughout

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Unified Voice**: Reads like one team, not three  
✅ **No Repetition**: Each concept appears once, referenced elsewhere  
✅ **Integrated Examples**: Code shows multiple characteristics at once  
✅ **Clear Structure**: Easy to navigate, 3-click rule for readers too  
✅ **Personality Shines**: Clumsy with words, clear with code, policy-obsessed  
✅ **Actionable**: Other teams know exactly what we do and how we help  
✅ **Concise**: 30% shorter without losing information

## Execution Plan

**Phase 1: Structure** (30 min)
- Create new section headers
- Map old content to new locations
- Identify what to consolidate vs. delete

**Phase 2: Content** (60 min)
- Write new "Our Character" section
- Consolidate philosophy sections
- Restructure "What We Own"
- Merge workflows

**Phase 3: Polish** (30 min)
- Remove duplication
- Add cross-references
- Ensure consistent voice
- Verify examples demonstrate multiple traits

**Phase 4: Validate** (15 min)
- Check for repetition
- Verify all characteristics are present
- Ensure personality is unified
- Confirm it's actionable for other teams

**Total Time**: ~2 hours for complete refactor

**Ready to execute?** This plan will transform the document from a fragmented collection into a cohesive, personality-driven team manifesto.
