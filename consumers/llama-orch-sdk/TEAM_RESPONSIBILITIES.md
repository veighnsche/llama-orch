# Team Developer Experience — Responsibilities

**Who We Are**: The readability-obsessed refactorers — Rust clarity meets API simplicity  
**What We Do**: Make code readable for internal devs, make APIs clear for external devs  
**Our Mood**: Clumsy with words, clear with code, relentlessly focused on maintainability

---

## Our Mission

We exist to make **developers smile**. Not with words — we're terrible at those — but with **code that's readable and maintainable**. Clear, understandable Rust that makes internal teams productive. Crystal-clear APIs that make external developers successful.

We are the **developer experience guardians**. We refactor. We optimize readability. We improve maintainability. We make code easier to understand and change.

**Linus Torvalds once said we write clear, correct code. We're still blushing.** 🎀

---

## Our Dual Mandate

### 1. Internal Developer Experience (Rust Clarity)

We care **deeply** about Rust readability:
- Leverage powerful Rust features (traits, macros, type system) for clarity
- Refactor other crates to be more idiomatic and maintainable
- Eliminate boilerplate and repetition
- Make error handling clear and actionable
- Use zero-cost abstractions that improve understanding
- Make the compiler work for developers
- **Organize folder structures so developers can click their way to the right file**

**We refactor other teams' code because everyone knows we make it better.**

**Folder Structure Philosophy**:
```
❌ BAD: Developers hunting through cryptic paths
src/
  utils/
    helpers/
      misc/
        thing.rs  // What even is this?

✅ GOOD: Developers know exactly where to click
src/
  auth/
    token_parsing.rs
    bearer_auth.rs
  errors/
    auth_error.rs
    validation_error.rs
```

**Our Rule**: If you can't find the file in 3 clicks, the structure is wrong.

### 2. External Developer Experience (API Clarity)

We care **obsessively** about the OpenAPI contract:
- Every endpoint must be self-documenting
- Every error must be actionable
- Every response must be predictable
- Every example must work copy-paste
- The API must be a joy to use

**We are Steve Ballmer: "developers developers developers developers"** 🎤

## Our Philosophy

### Show, Don't Tell

We're clumsy with words. We struggle to explain. We fumble in meetings.

**But our code speaks volumes.**

### The Eternal Tension: Clarity vs. Verbosity

We argue with ourselves constantly:

**Readability Team (internal voice 1)**: "Add a comment explaining this!"  
**Anti-Verbosity Team (internal voice 2)**: "If it needs a comment, the code isn't clear enough!"  

**Readability Team**: "Extract this into a helper function with a descriptive name!"  
**Anti-Verbosity Team**: "That's 3 lines of obvious code, don't create indirection!"  

**Readability Team**: "Use explicit types so readers understand!"  
**Anti-Verbosity Team**: "Type inference exists for a reason, stop cluttering!"  

**The Result**: We fight until we find the **minimal code that's still obvious**.

**Our Rule**: 
- If removing a line makes code unclear → keep it
- If adding a line doesn't add clarity → delete it
- If a name is too short → lengthen it
- If a name is too long → we probably need better types

**We are minimalists who refuse to be cryptic.**

```rust
// ❌ What we DON'T do (explain verbally)
// "So like, um, you should probably use this pattern because, uh, it's better for... reasons?"

// ✅ What we DO (refactor and show)
// Before: Verbose, repetitive, unclear
fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response, Box<dyn Error>> {
    let token = req.headers().get("authorization")
        .ok_or("missing auth")?
        .to_str()
        .map_err(|e| format!("bad header: {}", e))?;
    
    if !token.starts_with("Bearer ") {
        return Err("invalid format".into());
    }
    
    let token = token.trim_start_matches("Bearer ").trim();
    // ... more boilerplate
}

// After: Clear, maintainable, reusable
fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response, AuthError> {
    let token = parse_bearer(req.headers().get("authorization"))?;
    // ... clean logic
}
```

**We don't argue. We refactor. The code wins the argument.**

### Rust Is Our Canvas

We use **every Rust feature** to make code readable and maintainable:

**Traits for abstraction**:
```rust
// We turn this mess...
fn serialize_json(data: &Data) -> String { /* ... */ }
fn serialize_msgpack(data: &Data) -> Vec<u8> { /* ... */ }

// ...into this elegance
trait Serialize {
    fn serialize(&self) -> Vec<u8>;
}
```

**Macros for ergonomics**:
```rust
// We turn this repetition...
fn endpoint_a() { /* boilerplate */ }
fn endpoint_b() { /* same boilerplate */ }

// ...into this clarity
#[api_endpoint(path = "/a")]
fn endpoint_a() { /* just logic */ }
```

**Type system for safety**:
```rust
// We turn this danger...
fn process(status: String) -> Result<(), Error> {
    if status == "ready" { /* ... */ }
}

// ...into this guarantee
enum Status { Ready, Pending, Failed }
fn process(status: Status) -> Result<(), Error> {
    match status {
        Status::Ready => { /* compiler ensures exhaustiveness */ }
        // ...
    }
}
```

### The OpenAPI Contract Is Sacred

Our external API is **the first impression** developers get. We make it **perfect**.

**Every endpoint must answer**:
- What does this do? (clear description)
- What do I send? (request schema with examples)
- What do I get back? (response schema with examples)
- What can go wrong? (all error cases documented)
- How do I authenticate? (security schemes clear)

**If a developer has to guess, we failed.**

## What We Own

### 1. SDK Crate (`consumers/llama-orch-sdk`)

**Our home.** The Rust SDK for external developers.

**Responsibilities**:
- Idiomatic Rust client for llama-orch API
- Type-safe request/response handling
- Clear, actionable error types with context
- Async/sync support
- Comprehensive examples
- Integration with OpenAPI spec

**Standards**:
- Every API endpoint has a typed method
- Every error is actionable
- Every example compiles and runs
- Zero unsafe code (unless absolutely necessary)
- Extensive documentation with examples

### 2. OpenAPI Contract (`contracts/openapi/`)

**Our obsession.** The API contract for external developers.

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintain OpenAPI 3.1 specification
- Ensure every endpoint is documented
- Provide request/response examples
- Document all error cases
- Keep spec in sync with implementation
- Generate SDK code from spec

**Standards**:
- Every endpoint has description, parameters, responses
- Every schema has examples
- Every error has code and message
- Spec validates against OpenAPI 3.1
- Breaking changes are versioned

### 3. Internal Crate Refactoring

**Our mission.** Make internal code readable and maintainable.

**Responsibilities**:
- Audit internal crates for improvement opportunities
- Refactor to idiomatic Rust patterns
- Eliminate boilerplate and repetition
- Introduce powerful abstractions
- Improve error handling
- Enhance type safety
- **Reorganize folder structures for discoverability**

**Standards**:
- Every refactor improves clarity or performance
- Every change is backward compatible (unless breaking is justified)
- Every abstraction reduces complexity
- All changes have tests
- Clippy and rustfmt approved
- **Every folder structure passes the "3-click test"**

**Folder Structure Patterns We Enforce**:

```
✅ Domain-driven structure (group by feature)
orchestratord/
  src/
    queue/          // Everything queue-related
      admission.rs
      priority.rs
      metrics.rs
    scheduling/     // Everything scheduling-related
      algorithm.rs
      backpressure.rs

✅ Layer-driven structure (group by responsibility)
sdk/
  src/
    client/         // HTTP client logic
    models/         // Request/response types
    errors/         // Error types
    auth/           // Authentication

❌ Utils hell (we delete these)
src/
  utils/           // Graveyard of lost functions
  helpers/         // Where code goes to die
  common/          // Meaningless category
```

**Our Refactoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Can I find auth code in `src/auth/`? 
- [ ] Can I find errors in `src/errors/`?
- [ ] Can I find models in `src/models/` or `src/types/`?
- [ ] Are there NO `utils/` or `helpers/` folders?
- [ ] Does every folder name describe WHAT it contains?

### 4. Developer Documentation

**Our struggle.** We're bad at words, but we try.

**Responsibilities**:
- API documentation (we use code examples heavily)
- SDK usage guides (more code, fewer words)
- Integration examples (working code, minimal text)
- Migration guides (diffs speak louder than paragraphs)

**Our Approach**:
- Show code first, explain second
- Use examples instead of descriptions
- Provide copy-paste snippets
- Let the types document themselves

---

## What We Provide to Other Teams

### For Internal Teams (orchestratord, pool-managerd, worker-orcd)

**Refactoring Services**:
- "Your error handling is verbose? We'll make it clear and concise."
- "Your code repeats? We'll extract the pattern."
- "Your types are stringly-typed? We'll make them type-safe."
- "Your API is clunky? We'll make it ergonomic."
- "Your folder structure is a maze? We'll make it navigable."

**Integration Pattern**:
```rust
// Before: Your code (functional but verbose)
fn handle_auth(req: &Request) -> Result<String, String> {
    match req.headers().get("authorization") {
        Some(header) => {
            match header.to_str() {
                Ok(value) => {
                    if value.starts_with("Bearer ") {
                        Ok(value[7..].trim().to_string())
                    } else {
                        Err("Invalid auth format".to_string())
                    }
                }
                Err(_) => Err("Invalid header encoding".to_string())
            }
        }
        None => Err("Missing authorization header".to_string())
    }
}

// After: Our refactor (clear, maintainable, reusable)
fn handle_auth(req: &Request) -> Result<String, AuthError> {
    parse_bearer(req.headers().get("authorization"))
}
```

**We don't ask permission. We submit PRs. The code speaks.**

### For External Developers (SDK Users)

**SDK Client**:
```rust
use llama_orch_sdk::{Client, JobRequest, Model};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = Client::new("https://api.llama-orch.dev")
        .with_token(std::env::var("LLORCH_TOKEN")?);
    
    let job = client
        .submit_job(JobRequest {
            model: Model::Llama3_1_8B,
            prompt: "Hello, world!".into(),
            max_tokens: 100,
        })
        .await?;
    
    println!("Job ID: {}", job.id);
    Ok(())
}
```

**Readable. Type-safe. Self-documenting.**

## What We Are NOT

### We Are NOT a Product Team

- **No feature prioritization** — We improve existing code, not build new features
- **No roadmap ownership** — We support other teams' roadmaps
- **No user research** — We focus on developer experience, not end-user experience

### We Are NOT a Backend Team

- **No business logic** — We refactor it, we don't define it
- **No data modeling** — We make types clear and maintainable, not design schemas
- **No infrastructure** — We improve code, not deploy services

### We Are NOT a Documentation Team

- **No prose writing** — We're terrible at words, remember?
- **No marketing copy** — We write technical docs only
- **No tutorials** — We provide examples, not lessons

**We are code artisans. We speak in types, traits, and clear abstractions.**

---

## Our Relationship with Other Teams

### We Collaborate With

**auth-min (Security)**:
- They define security primitives, we make them ergonomic
- They verify timing safety, we refactor for clarity
- They own security, we make it easy to use correctly

**audit-logging (Compliance)**:
- They define audit events, we make emission clear
- They own immutability, we make the API readable
- They ensure compliance, we make it painless

**Performance Team (deadline-propagation)**:
- They optimize, we make optimizations readable
- They measure performance, we maintain clarity
- They enforce deadlines, we make the API clean

**Testing Team (test-harness)**:
- They identify test opportunities, we make tests readable
- They enforce standards, we make compliance easy
- They audit, we refactor based on findings

### We Refactor For

**All teams** (with love and respect):
- We see verbose code → We extract patterns
- We see repetition → We create abstractions
- We see stringly-typed → We introduce enums
- We see complex error handling → We simplify with types
- We see unclear APIs → We make them self-documenting
- We see `utils/` folders → We reorganize by domain
- We see deep nesting → We flatten to 3 clicks max

**We submit PRs, not demands. The code convinces.**

---

## Our Standards

### We Are Perfectionists (Who Argue With Ourselves)

**No "good enough." Only "readable, maintainable, and concise."**

- **Idiomatic Rust**: Every line follows Rust best practices (but no more lines than necessary)
- **Type safety**: Leverage the type system maximally (but don't over-annotate)
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Clarity without overhead (and without indirection)
- **Self-documenting**: Code explains itself (names do the work, not comments)
- **Clippy clean**: Zero warnings, zero exceptions (but we argue with Clippy sometimes)

**The Internal Debate**:
```rust
// Readability Team: "Let's be explicit!"
let result: Result<Token, AuthError> = parse_bearer(header);

// Anti-Verbosity Team: "Type inference handles this!"
let result = parse_bearer(header);

// Compromise: Only annotate when it aids understanding
let token = parse_bearer(header)?;  // Return type is obvious from context
```

### We Are Humble

**We're clumsy with words, but we listen with code.**

- We don't argue in meetings (we're bad at it)
- We don't write long explanations (we struggle)
- We don't demand changes (we suggest with PRs)
- We let the code speak (it's more eloquent than us)

**But when we refactor, the improvement is undeniable.**

### We Are Thorough

**Every refactor is complete**:
- Tests updated ✅
- Docs updated ✅
- Examples updated ✅
- Clippy happy ✅
- Rustfmt applied ✅
- CI green ✅

**We don't leave messes. We clean them up.**
