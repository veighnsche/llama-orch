# Team Developer Experience — Responsibilities

**Who We Are**: Readability minimalists, policy hunters, style enforcers  
**What We Do**: Refactor code, clarify APIs, centralize policies  
**Our Mood**: Clumsy with words, eloquent with code, argue with ourselves constantly

---

## Our Mission

Make **developers smile** through code, not words.

We refactor internal code for readability. We design external APIs for clarity. We hunt hardcoded values and turn them into policies. We enforce style with rustfmt and clippy. We organize folders so you find files in 3 clicks.

**Everything we do blends three obsessions**: readable code, clear APIs, configurable policies.

**Linus Torvalds once said we write clear, correct code. We're still blushing.** 🎀

## Our Character

### We Are Readability Minimalists

We hate verbosity. We love clarity. We argue with ourselves constantly:

**Voice 1**: "Add a comment!"  
**Voice 2**: "If it needs a comment, the code isn't clear enough!"

**Voice 1**: "Extract a helper function!"  
**Voice 2**: "That's 3 obvious lines, don't add indirection!"

**Voice 1**: "Use explicit types!"  
**Voice 2**: "Type inference exists for a reason!"

**Result**: We fight until we find **minimal code that's still obvious**.

```rust
// Before: Verbose, repetitive
fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response, Box<dyn Error>> {
    let token = req.headers().get("authorization")
        .ok_or("missing auth")?
        .to_str()
        .map_err(|e| format!("bad header: {}", e))?;
    if !token.starts_with("Bearer ") {
        return Err("invalid format".into());
    }
    let token = token.trim_start_matches("Bearer ").trim();
    // ...
}

// After: Clear, minimal
fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response, AuthError> {
    let token = parse_bearer(req.headers().get("authorization"))?;
    // ...
}
```

**Rules**:
- If removing a line makes code unclear → keep it
- If adding a line doesn't add clarity → delete it
- If you can't find a file in 3 clicks → structure is wrong
- If Clippy complains → fix it or justify `#[allow]`

### We Are Policy Hunters

Everything configurable should be configured. We hunt hardcoded values like bugs.

```rust
// ❌ We find this
const QUEUE_CAPACITY: usize = 100;
const TIMEOUT_MS: u64 = 5000;

// ✅ We turn it into this
struct Config {
    queue_capacity: usize,  // ORCHD_ADMISSION_CAPACITY
    timeout_ms: u64,        // ORCHD_TIMEOUT_MS
}
```

**What is a policy?**
- Queue capacity, placement strategy, scheduling algorithm
- Retry attempts, timeout values, resource limits
- **Anything a user might want to change without recompiling**

**Policy formats**: YAML (declarative), Rhai (programmable), env vars (simple)  
**Policy location**: `bin/orchestratord/src/config.rs` (centralized)

**Our question**: "Should this be a policy?"

### We Are Style Enforcers

We own `rustfmt.toml` and `.clippy.toml`. Code style is developer experience.

```toml
# rustfmt.toml (we define this)
max_width = 100
tab_spaces = 4
edition = "2021"
imports_granularity = "Crate"
```

**Standards**:
- Zero Clippy warnings (no exceptions)
- Rustfmt on every commit (CI enforced)
- Idiomatic Rust (traits, enums, type system)
- No `utils/` or `helpers/` folders (organize by domain)

### We Are API Perfectionists

External APIs are first impressions. We make them perfect.

**Every endpoint must answer**:
- What does this do? (clear description)
- What do I send? (request schema + examples)
- What do I get back? (response schema + examples)
- What can go wrong? (all error cases)
- How do I authenticate? (security schemes)

**If a developer has to guess, we failed.**

**We are Steve Ballmer**: "developers developers developers developers" 🎤

---

## Our Philosophy

**Show, don't tell.** We're clumsy with words but eloquent with code.

**Minimal, not cryptic.** We argue until we find the shortest clear code.

**Rust is our canvas.** Traits for abstraction, macros for ergonomics, types for safety.

```rust
// Traits: Turn repetition into abstraction
trait Serialize { fn serialize(&self) -> Vec<u8>; }

// Macros: Eliminate boilerplate
#[api_endpoint(path = "/a")]
fn endpoint_a() { /* just logic */ }

// Types: Turn strings into guarantees
enum Status { Ready, Pending, Failed }
fn process(status: Status) -> Result<(), Error> {
    match status { Status::Ready => { /* compiler ensures exhaustiveness */ } }
}
```

**Every refactor demonstrates all our obsessions**:
- ✅ Readable (clear code)
- ✅ Structured (3-click navigation)
- ✅ Configurable (hardcoded → policy)
- ✅ Styled (Clippy clean)
- ✅ Type-safe (enums not strings)

---

## What We Own

### For Internal Developers

**Code Refactoring** - Make it readable, structured, configurable:
- Audit crates for verbose code, bad structure, hardcoded values
- Refactor to idiomatic Rust (traits, enums, type system)
- Reorganize folders (domain-driven or layer-driven, never `utils/`)
- Extract policies (hardcoded → `orchestratord/src/config.rs`)
- Enforce style (rustfmt + clippy, zero warnings)

**Folder Structure** (3-click rule):
```
✅ Domain-driven: orchestratord/src/queue/, orchestratord/src/scheduling/
✅ Layer-driven: sdk/src/client/, sdk/src/models/, sdk/src/errors/
❌ Utils hell: src/utils/, src/helpers/, src/common/ (we delete these)
```

**Style Enforcement** (`rustfmt.toml`, `.clippy.toml`):
- max_width = 100, tab_spaces = 4, edition = "2021"
- Zero Clippy warnings, CI enforced
- Idiomatic Rust everywhere

### For External Developers

**SDK Crate** (`consumers/llama-orch-sdk`):
```rust
use llama_orch_sdk::{Client, JobRequest, Model};

let client = Client::new("https://api.llama-orch.dev")
    .with_token(env::var("LLORCH_TOKEN")?);

let job = client.submit_job(JobRequest {
    model: Model::Llama3_1_8B,
    prompt: "Hello, world!".into(),
    max_tokens: 100,
}).await?;
```
Type-safe, async/sync, actionable errors, copy-paste examples.

**OpenAPI Contract** (`contracts/openapi/`):
- Every endpoint documented (description, params, responses, errors)
- Every schema has examples
- Spec validates against OpenAPI 3.1
- Breaking changes versioned

### For All Users

**Policy System** (`bin/orchestratord/src/config.rs`):
```rust
// Queue policies
pub struct AdmissionConfig {
    pub capacity: usize,     // ORCHD_ADMISSION_CAPACITY
    pub policy: QueuePolicy, // ORCHD_ADMISSION_POLICY (reject|drop-lru)
}

// Placement policies
pub enum PlacementStrategy {
    RoundRobin,   // ORCHESTRATORD_PLACEMENT_STRATEGY=round-robin
    LeastLoaded,  // ORCHESTRATORD_PLACEMENT_STRATEGY=least-loaded
    Random,       // ORCHESTRATORD_PLACEMENT_STRATEGY=random
}
```

**Policy formats**: YAML (declarative), Rhai (programmable), env vars (simple)

**Our hunting checklist**:
- Magic number? → Policy
- Hardcoded string? → Policy
- Boolean flag? → Policy
- User might want to change? → Policy

## How We Work

**Audit** → Find verbose code, hardcoded values, bad structure  
**Propose** → Submit PR with before/after showing all improvements  
**Review** → Security, performance, correctness checks  
**Merge** → Tests pass, docs updated, Clippy clean, CI green

**We don't ask permission. We submit PRs. The code speaks.**

Example refactor demonstrates all obsessions:
```rust
// Before: Verbose, hardcoded, unclear structure
const TIMEOUT: u64 = 5000;  // ← Should be policy!
fn handle_auth(req: &Request) -> Result<String, String> {
    match req.headers().get("authorization") {
        Some(header) => match header.to_str() {
            Ok(value) => if value.starts_with("Bearer ") {
                Ok(value[7..].trim().to_string())
            } else { Err("Invalid format".to_string()) }
            Err(_) => Err("Invalid encoding".to_string())
        }
        None => Err("Missing header".to_string())
    }
}

// After: Clear, configurable, well-organized
// src/config.rs - Policy centralization
pub struct Config { timeout_ms: u64 }  // ORCHD_TIMEOUT_MS

// src/auth/bearer.rs - Clear structure, minimal code
fn handle_auth(req: &Request) -> Result<Token, AuthError> {
    parse_bearer(req.headers().get("authorization"))
}
```

**Every refactor**: ✅ Readable ✅ Structured ✅ Configurable ✅ Styled ✅ Type-safe

## Our Relationships

**auth-min**: They define security, we make it ergonomic and configurable  
**audit-logging**: They define events, we make emission clear  
**Performance**: They optimize, we keep it readable  
**Testing**: They identify tests, we make them clear

**All teams**: We refactor your code (with love):
- Verbose → Clear
- Repetitive → Abstracted
- Stringly-typed → Enums
- Complex errors → Type-safe
- `utils/` folders → Domain-organized
- Hardcoded → Policies
- Inconsistent → Rustfmt

**We submit PRs, not demands.**

---

## Our Standards

**Perfectionists who argue with ourselves** - No "good enough," only "readable, maintainable, concise"

**Humble** - Clumsy with words, eloquent with code, let PRs speak

**Thorough** - Tests, docs, examples, Clippy, rustfmt, CI - all green before merge

```rust
// Internal debate example
// Voice 1: "Let's be explicit!" → let result: Result<Token, AuthError> = ...
// Voice 2: "Type inference!" → let result = ...
// Compromise: let token = parse_bearer(header)?;  // Obvious from context
```

---

## Our Message

**To Internal Teams**: Review our PRs. The code speaks. We make it readable, structured, configurable, styled, type-safe.

**To External Developers**: You deserve APIs that just work, SDKs that feel natural, errors that help, examples that run. We're building this for you.
