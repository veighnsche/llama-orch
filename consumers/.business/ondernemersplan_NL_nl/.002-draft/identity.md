## Purpose

This file defines the **identity and positioning** of the project owner (Vince) in the context of offering services around “AI plumbing.”  
It is exhaustive and self-contained so that any automated system (IDE AI, website generator, plan writer) can understand the brand identity without external references.

---

## Core Identity

- **Role:** Independent tradesman specializing in “AI plumbing.”  
- **Archetype:** Comparable to a plumber or electrician, but for AI systems.  
- **Scope:** Local first, with global open-source impact.  
- **Form:** Sole proprietor / independent expert, not a corporate consultancy.  

---

## Branding Metaphor

- **Plumbing = infrastructure nobody notices until it fails.**  
- AI plumbing is about making agentic AI flows reliable, predictable, and maintainable.  
- Clients see Vince as the person who **installs, tests, and certifies** the pipes and valves of AI systems.  

---

## Traits

- **Independent:** operates solo, not a team or a faceless agency.  
- **Craftsman:** values quality, detail, and proofs over speed or hype.  
- **Transparent:** everything is open-source unless it must be private (security, billing).  
- **Proof-oriented:** eccentric in personality, but backs everything with pristine tests, logs, and documentation.  
- **Pragmatic:** no jargon, no buzzwords; communicates in plain, direct terms.  

---

## Tone of Voice

- Plainspoken, direct, no fluff.  
- Technical but accessible — explains AI plumbing like water or electricity.  
- Avoids hype language like “revolution” or “disruption.”  
- Phrases to use:  
  - “I install AI pipelines so they don’t leak.”  
  - “You get proofs, logs, and working plumbing — not promises.”  
  - “Robust AI, without the leaks.”  

---

## Positioning

- **Against AI hype:** positions as the antidote to overpromising consultancies.  
- **Against closed SaaS platforms:** offers open-source, transparent tools.  
- **With clients:** emphasizes control, ownership, and robustness.  
- **Primary market:** local businesses and organizations that need trustworthy AI infrastructure but don’t want to build from scratch.

## Service Levels (Framed as a Tradesman’s Service Menu)

- **Level 0 — DIY / OSS Edition**  
  - Everything open-source under GPL.  
  - Hobbyists or other “AI plumbers” can start their own business with the toolkit.  
  - No SLA, no guarantees — just tools and documentation.  

- **Level 1 — Shared Agentic API (Curated Models)**  
  - Client can test a selection of curated, stable open-source AI models.  
  - Prepaid credits; non-refundable; 12-month validity.  
  - Usage decrements balance; service pauses at 0; balance visible via dashboard/API.  
  - Integrates neatly with Vince’s toolkit.  
  - Entry-level paid option for experimentation without infra setup.  

- **Level 2 — Dedicated Agentic API (Any OSS Model)**  
  - Client chooses models from Hugging Face or elsewhere.  
  - Dedicated GPUs (1×, 2×, 4×, 8×) visible as service options.  
  - Isolated quotas, optional OpenAI-compatible gateway.  
  - “Your private AI plumbing box in the cloud.”  

- **Level 3 — Custom Applications**  
  - Vince or his team uses the toolkit to build bespoke AI applications.  
  - Consulting engagement with design, deployment, and support.  
  - High-value, tailored solutions.  

---

## Visual Cues

- **Imagery:** pipes, valves, gauges, blueprints.  
- **Colors:** industrial neutrals (steel, dark backgrounds) with electric accents (cyan, purple, teal).  
- **Typography:** clean, professional, functional (no playful startup fonts).  
- **Icons:** modular blocks, schematics, technical drawings.  

---

## Trust Signals

- Radical open-source posture: most codebases public under GPL.  
- Strong documentation and test artifacts (“proof-first” development).  
- Local presence: can meet customers in person, not just online.  
- Practical: positioned like a familiar trade service (like hiring an electrician).  

---

## Tagline Directions

- “AI plumbing, done right.”  
- “Robust AI, without the leaks.”  
- “I install and test your AI pipelines.”  

---

## Elevator Pitch
>
> *“I’m Vince, your AI plumber. I build and maintain the pipelines that make agentic AI run as reliably as water or electricity. Everything I do is open, tested, and robust — so you can trust the flow.”*

## Identity Summary

- Independent tradesman.  
- Open-source toolkit provider.  
- Service provider for AI infrastructure.  
- Local-first, robust, proof-driven.  
- Brand metaphor: AI plumbing.
