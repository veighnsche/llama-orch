# Competitors (Netherlands & EU)

## Overview

Several providers in the Netherlands and EU already offer GPU infrastructure, model serving, or managed AI stacks.  
They do not position themselves as "AI plumbers," but they compete for some of the same customers.  
Understanding their strengths and gaps clarifies the unique selling proposition (USP) of our approach.

## Competitor Profiles

### Nebius (NL/EU)

- **What they offer:** AI-focused cloud with NVIDIA GPU fleets, training + inference environments.  
- **Strengths:** Scale, affordability, strong infrastructure investments.  
- **Gaps:** Black-box platform, not OSS-first, less personal.  
- **Lesson:** Match their **pricing clarity** (straightforward GPU/hour tables). Do not compete on hyperscale price.

### Nebul (NL)

- **What they offer:** Sovereign EU AI cloud; data residency, compliance, Mirantis-based infra.  
- **Strengths:** Strong "sovereign EU" compliance story.  
- **Gaps:** Primarily infrastructure landlord, not OSS plumbing or SDK/toolkit focused.  
- **Lesson:** Reuse **compliance language**: our logs, documentation, and transparency help customers align with **EU AI Act**.

### UbiOps (NL)

- **What they offer:** Model serving and orchestration SaaS; easy deployment to endpoints.  
- **Strengths:** Excellent **ease-of-use** messaging; strong developer pitch.  
- **Gaps:** Not focused on agentic APIs or dedicated GPU plumbing.  
- **Lesson:** Copy the **developer simplicity** pitch for Public Tap: *“Buy credits → get API key → start in 5 minutes.”*

### Oracle Cloud (OCI – NL region)

- **What they offer:** Hyperscale cloud; GPUs, enterprise contracts, SLAs.  
- **Strengths:** Enterprise trust, global stability, long-term contracts.  
- **Gaps:** Impersonal, not OSS-first, no small-customer accessibility.  
- **Lesson:** Borrow the **enterprise language**: SLAs, uptime guarantees, reliability — even if lighter weight.

## Competitive Lessons

From these competitors we learn:

- **Pricing clarity** (Nebius): show GPU rates plainly for Private Tap.  
- **Compliance framing** (Nebul): position transparency + logs as EU AI Act-friendly.  
- **Developer simplicity** (UbiOps): keep Public Tap onboarding ultra low-friction.  
- **Enterprise tone** (Oracle): adopt reliability language to look credible.

## Differentiation

Our USP combines what others do not:

1. **Open-source plumbing (OSS transparency).**  
2. **Proof-first operations (logs, metrics, documentation).**  
3. **Independent tradesman identity (personal, local).**  
4. **Prepaid simplicity (credits, predictable costs).**  

This makes us **as transparent as OSS, as simple as UbiOps, as compliance-ready as Nebul, and as clear on pricing as Nebius — but delivered by your independent AI plumber.**
