# Target Audiences (Marketing Website)

## Overview

The marketing site is for **business and adoption**, not for technical documentation.  
Its purpose is to explain **why llama-orch and the plumbing services matter** to different audiences, and guide them to the right entry point (OSS, Public Tap, Private Tap, or custom toolkit work).
