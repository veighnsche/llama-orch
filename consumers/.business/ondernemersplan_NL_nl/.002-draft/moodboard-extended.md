## Purpose

This file extends the base mood board with **visual synonym categories** that translate the metaphor of plumbing into AI/devops imagery.  
The goal is to provide a broad palette of consistent design directions.

---

## Overall Vibe

- **Blue-collar serious**: sturdy, functional, no hype.  
- **Mechanical but minimal**: pipes, valves, gauges — used sparingly, not overloaded.  
- **Infrastructure first**: visuals communicate robustness and reliability.  
- **Approachable edge**: option for a mascot or simplified cartoons.  
- **Customer-facing**: neat, clean, functional diagrams that are still visually attractive.

## Core Themes & Synonyms

### 1. Pipes & Flow

- **Metaphor:** AI pipelines as literal pipes.  
- **Visuals:** ducts, conduits, glowing streams.  
- **Elements:** joints, valves, gauges.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Flat vector pipes carrying glowing data flows, minimal cyan/teal accents.”  
  - “Pipeline junction with labeled valves, blueprint style.”  

---

### 2. Blueprints & Schematics

- **Metaphor:** AI infra = technical drawings.  
- **Visuals:** CAD grids, diagrams, measurements.  
- **Elements:** boxes, arrows, nodes, annotations.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Blueprint schematic of AI system with labeled pipes and blocks, cyan lines on dark.”  
  - “Isometric diagram of pipelines with arrowed flows, robust engineering aesthetic.”  

---

### 3. Control Panels & Gauges

- **Metaphor:** monitoring system health.  
- **Visuals:** dials, gauges, switches, indicator lights.  
- **Elements:** pressure meters, toggle switches, fuse boxes.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Minimal vector control panel with gauges and glowing LEDs, teal/purple accents.”  
  - “Industrial pressure gauge repurposed as AI metrics dial, clean vector style.”  

---

### 4. Testing & Certification

- **Metaphor:** robustness proven, not promised.  
- **Visuals:** checkmarks, logs, clipboards, stamps.  
- **Elements:** inspection tags, proof labels.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Blueprint diagram with stamped checkmarks and certified label, minimal vector.”  
  - “Clean report-style illustration with green ticks on pipeline components.”  

---

### 5. Workshop & Tools

- **Metaphor:** OSS toolkits as wrenches and screwdrivers.  
- **Visuals:** toolboxes, racks of modular blocks.  
- **Elements:** labeled tools, workshop wall.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Vector toolbox with AI-themed tools (chip-shaped wrench, glowing screwdriver).”  
  - “Clean workbench illustration with labeled blocks and SDK utils icons.”  

---

### 6. Infrastructure Parallels

- **Metaphor:** computing infra as plumbing infra.  
- **Visuals:** servers = boilers, cables = pipes.  
- **Elements:** racks, tanks, valves connected to computers.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Server rack with pipes coming out, blueprint aesthetic.”  
  - “Cloud water tank feeding pipelines of data into computers.”  

---

### 7. Robustness & Reliability

- **Metaphor:** industrial strength, built to last.  
- **Visuals:** thick beams, reinforced connectors, bolts.  
- **Elements:** ISO-like certification plates, robust brackets.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Vector pipes with oversized bolts and reinforced joints, sturdy style.”  
  - “Industrial connector labeled with load capacity, blueprint style.”  

---

### 8. Mascot Options

- **Metaphor:** friendly face of AI plumbing.  
- **Visuals:** non-human mascots made of tools or pipes.  
- **Elements:** eyes on a toolbox, pipe character with gauge face.  
- **Prompts:**  
  - “Cartoon mascot shaped like a toolbox with eyes, friendly but serious.”  
  - “Pipe-shaped character with glowing data flow inside, cartoon minimal style.”  
  - “Pressure gauge with eyes and a small wrench, AI plumbing mascot.”  

---

## Color Palette (Extended)

- **Base neutrals:** off-white `#f5f5f5`, light gray `#e0e0e0`, slate `#2c2f35`.  
- **Accents:** cyan `#22d3ee`, teal `#2dd4bf`, purple `#7c5cff`.  
- **Utility:** green `#22c55e` (success/proof), red `#ef4444` (critical).  

---

## Typography

- **Headings:** bold industrial sans (IBM Plex Sans, Inter, Source Sans).  
- **Body:** clean, readable sans-serif.  
- **Aesthetic:** signage and technical documentation, not startup gloss.  

---

## Emotional Keywords

- Robust  
- Functional  
- Approachable  
- Blue-collar  
- Electrical  
- Proof-first  

---

## Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Show pipes, diagrams, gauges in simple vector/blueprint style.  
- ✅ Use cyan/teal/purple for electrical highlights.  
- ✅ Make diagrams neat enough for customer-facing admiration.  
- ✅ Consider a mascot that embodies friendliness without losing seriousness.  
- ❌ Don’t show literal human plumbers.  
- ❌ Don’t lean on photoreal textures (steel, copper).  
- ❌ Don’t mimic startup SaaS minimalism or corporate gloss.
