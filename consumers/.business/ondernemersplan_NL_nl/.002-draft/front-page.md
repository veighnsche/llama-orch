# Section 1 — Why businesses need “AI plumbing”

**Headline**
Why companies need private, robust AI pipelines

**Copy (short, business-speak)**
Most teams want AI in production, but run into the same issues: data privacy, vendor lock-in, unpredictable costs, and fragile infra. The EU AI Act raises the bar on documentation and risk controls. A managed, open, and private alternative is often the sensible choice. ([Stanford HAI][1])

**Bullets**

* **Adoption is real:** a strong majority of organizations report using AI and seeing value; infra and governance are now the bottlenecks. ([Stanford HAI][1])
* **Privacy & control:** many enterprises prefer **private LLMs** for data protection, custom policies, and consistent performance. ([Matillion][2])
* **Compliance pressure:** the **EU AI Act** adds obligations for documentation, risk management, and transparency—good plumbing helps meet them. ([Digital Strategy EU][3])

# Section 2 — What I offer (simple model)

**H2**
Three things, one toolbox

**Card 1 — OSS (Foundation)**

* **Open-source** orchestrator, SDK, and utils: inspect everything, or run it yourself.
* Built around high-throughput serving engines (e.g. vLLM) for efficient inference. ([GitHub][4])

**Card 2 — Public Tap (Prepaid)**

* **Shared** agentic API on curated OSS models.
* **Prepaid credits** (non-refundable, 12-month shelf life) for predictable costs. Stripe supports credit-based billing patterns out of the box. ([Stripe][5])
* Perfect for pilots, demos, and integration testing.

**Card 3 — Private Tap (Dedicated)**

* Your **own** API endpoint, your **own** GPUs (1×/2×/4×/8×), your **choice** of OSS models (e.g., from Hugging Face).
* Managed orchestration, monitoring, and logs. GPU pricing is transparent and maps to public market rates (A100/H100). ([Runpod][6])

---

# Section 3 — Public Tap (the fast on-ramp)

**H2**
Public Tap — test fast, pay upfront

**Pitch**
Buy credits, point your SDK, and see results. No invoices, no surprises—just a clean test bench for OSS models.

**What you get**

* Curated model set (stable OSS)
* SSE streaming, logs, and sample blueprints
* **Prepaid credits**: €50 / €200 / €500 packs; baseline €1.20 per 1M tokens (input+output)

**Notes**

* Credits are **non-refundable**; 12-month validity.
* Designed for developers, agencies, and IT teams to validate ideas quickly.

**CTA**

# Section 4 — Private Tap (the business engine)

**H2**
Private Tap — your own AI API, on dedicated GPUs

**Pitch**
When privacy, control, or performance matter, a dedicated tap is simply safer. We provision GPUs, deploy your models, and operate the plumbing: orchestration, upgrades, observability, and guardrails.

**Pricing snapshot** *(example, subject to provider rates)*

* **A100 80GB** — €1.80 / GPU-hour + €250 / month base fee (ops & SLA)
* **H100 80GB** — €3.80 / GPU-hour + €400 / month base fee
* Scale 1×/2×/4×/8× GPUs; prepaid hour blocks; optional OpenAI-compatible gateway
  *(Reference: public cloud GPU rates are widely published.)* ([Runpod][6])

**What you get (bullets)**

* Your endpoint, your models (OSS), your quotas
* Managed by an independent expert (not a black-box platform)
* Prometheus metrics & logs; proof-first deployment routines
* Built for high-throughput serving (e.g., vLLM: PagedAttention, continuous batching) ([GitHub][4])

**CTA**

# Section 5 — Proof, not promises

**H2**
We prove it works—before you rely on it

**Items**

* Deployment report with **SSE transcripts**, throughput & latency metrics
* **Prometheus** dashboard snapshots and alert thresholds
* Version pinning and roll-back plan
* **Documentation bundle** aligned with EU AI Act transparency ethos (technical docs & logs help your internal governance) ([Digital Strategy EU][3])

**Microcopy**
This is infrastructure—like water or electricity. You shouldn’t have to “trust” it. You should see it.

---

# Section 6 — Who it’s for

**H2**
Designed for IT teams and agencies—usable by anyone

* **IT teams** who need a private API and model choice without hiring a whole platform team
* **Agencies** reselling AI infra or shipping client pilots quickly (start on Public Tap, upgrade to Private)
* **Compliance-sensitive orgs** that can’t push everything through US-hosted black boxes; **private LLMs** help control data and policy. ([Matillion][2])

# Section 7 — FAQs

**Is this cheaper than OpenAI?**
No. If you want the absolute lowest token price, use OpenAI. If you want **transparency, EU-friendly deployments, model choice, and dedicated GPUs**, use a Private Tap. (For testing, use the Public Tap.)

**Can I bring any OSS model?**
Yes. For Private Taps, pick from Hugging Face or other sources; we’ll validate VRAM and deploy.

**How do prepaid credits work on the Public Tap?**
Buy a pack, get a token balance, consume until 0. Non-refundable; 12-month validity. Your balance is always visible via API/dashboard. Stripe supports credits workflows natively. ([Stripe][5])

**What makes your serving stack efficient?**
We use open-source, high-throughput serving engines (e.g., **vLLM** with PagedAttention and continuous batching) and expose metrics for real SLOs. ([GitHub][4])

**Are you EU AI Act ready?**
We’re not a law firm, but we operate with its **documentation and transparency** spirit in mind (risk-aware, logged, documented deployments). The Act is in force and raises expectations for providers and users of AI systems. ([Digital Strategy EU][3])

## Image checklist (for this page)

1. **Hero** — `hero_pipes.webp` (alt = prompt above)
2. **Problem→Solution panel** — split image: messy vs fixed pipelines
3. **Public Tap** — “metered tap” icon; simple grid of curated models
4. **Private Tap** — dedicated pipe into a building; GPU options row
5. **Proof section** — screenshots of Grafana/Prometheus and a green-stamped diagram
6. **About Vince** — small portrait or simplified icon/mascot

## Business-feasibility anchors (why this makes sense)

* Demand is broad and growing; infra and governance are now the hard parts (not ideas). ([Stanford HAI][1])
* Many enterprises prefer **private LLMs** for privacy, custom policies, and predictable performance. ([Matillion][2])
* The **EU AI Act** raises onboarding/documentation standards that favor transparent, controllable deployments. ([Digital Strategy EU][3])
* Efficient serving (e.g., **vLLM**) reduces cost and latency and is widely recognized in production. ([GitHub][4])
* GPU costs are public and comprehensible (A100/H100 hourly rates), making your **Private Tap** pricing easy to justify. ([Runpod][6])
