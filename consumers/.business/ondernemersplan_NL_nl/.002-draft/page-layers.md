> Status: Future proposal — not implemented in Draft 2 (see `index.md` §C).

## Layer 0 — Root (Front Page)

**Purpose:** A single entry that works for *all* audiences.
**Goal:** Self-routing: users click the CTA that resonates with them.

* **Hero section** — USP distilled (AI plumbing, done right).
* **3 main offers:** OSS → Public Tap → Private Tap.
* **Extra:** small link to “Custom Toolkit Development.”
* **Trust signals:** open source, EU AI Act readiness, proof-first.
* **CTA buttons route by audience:**

  * “Start free with OSS” → Developers/Hobbyists.
  * “Buy prepaid credits” → Public Tap page.
  * “Get a Private Tap quote” → Private Tap page.

## Layer 1 — Segmentation Pages

Audience-friendly landing pages that deepen the pitch.

1. **For Developers & Hobbyists**

   * OSS tools, GitHub links, tutorials.
   * Public Tap starter credits.
   * Blog posts with practical setups.

2. **For IT Teams (SMEs, agencies)**

   * Case studies showing deployment.

3. **For Compliance-Sensitive Orgs (finance, healthcare, gov)**

   * Private Tap + compliance framing.
   * EU AI Act transparency, audit bundles.

4. **For Small Businesses (custom toolkit)**

## Layer 3 — Proof & Trust Pages

Content for credibility and SEO depth.

* **Proof Library**

  * Sample deployment logs, Prometheus dashboards, config reports.
  * Framed like an electrician’s certificate.

* **Case Studies**

  * Agencies: pilot → private migration.

* **Competitors Page**

  * Transparent overview of alternatives and why AI plumbing is distinct.

## Layer 4 — Supporting Pages

Catch all the “what if” traffic and reassure funders.

## Routing Principles

* **Front page** = broad appeal, all CTAs visible.
* **Segmentation pages** = audience-specific, 1–2 layers deep.
* **Service pages** = SEO optimized (token pricing, GPU pricing).
* **Proof pages** = for IT & compliance buyers.
* **Docs subdomain** = clearly separate (technical only).

# 📑 Page Estimate in Mesh Model

### Layer 0 — Front Page

* **1 page** (universal hub, widest net).

### Layer 1 — Big Category Groups

Think of these as **broad umbrellas** (each spans multiple audiences).

* Example groups:

  * *Makers* (Hobbyists + Agencies)
  * *Operators* (IT Teams + Compliance)
  * *Backers* (Small Biz + Funders)
* **≈ 3–4 pages**

### Layer 2 — Smaller Overlaps

Split the umbrellas into **smaller mixed groups**.

* Examples:

  * Makers → Hobbyists + Agencies (fast prototyping)
  * Operators → IT + Compliance (Private Tap)
  * Backers → Funders + IT (ROI evidence)
  * Small Biz + Agencies (toolkit projects)
* **≈ 5–7 pages**

### Layer 3 — Narrowed Bundles

Each smaller group starts looking **more audience-specific**, with light cross-links.

* Examples:

  * Deep dive on OSS/Public Tap (Hobbyists, but Agencies reference it).
  * Private Tap pricing/ops (IT, but Compliance references governance).
  * Reseller/partner flows (Agencies, with Small Biz case study cross-link).
  * Business model docs (Funders, with IT revenue proof).
* **≈ 6–8 pages**

### Layer 4 — Endpoints (Unique Pages)

Each **audience has its own final page** (cryptic in naming, but audience-specific in content).

* Hobbyists → Docs portal.
* IT → SLA/Contract pack.
* Agencies → Reseller agreements.
* Compliance → Governance pack.
* Small Biz → Toolkit proposal template.
* Funders → Financial model pack.
* **≈ 6 pages**
