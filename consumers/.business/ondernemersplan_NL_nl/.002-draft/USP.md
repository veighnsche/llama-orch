# Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

## Overview

We are not "just another GPU cloud" or "just another model serving platform."  
Our identity as an **independent AI plumber** combines four strengths into a package no Dutch/EU competitor currently leads with.

---

## Core USP Pillars

### 1. Open-Source Plumbing (Transparency)

- All core tools — **llama-orch, utils, SDK** — are published under GPL.  
- Customers can inspect, fork, or self-host the orchestrator.  
- **Message:** *“I don’t just host AI infra — I hand you the blueprints.”*  

### 2. Proof-First Operations

- Deployments come with **logs, Prometheus metrics, SSE transcripts, and version-pinned configs.**  
- Customers don’t need to "trust" marketing claims; they see evidence.  
- Aligns naturally with **EU AI Act transparency requirements**.  
- **Message:** *“You don’t have to trust me — you see proof your pipelines work.”*  

### 3. Independent Tradesman Identity

- Not a startup chasing VC. Not a hyperscaler’s anonymous support queue.  
- **Personal, local, approachable:** Vince as the named expert.  
- **Message:** *“I’m your AI plumber — practical, robust, and accountable.”*  

### 4. Prepaid Simplicity

- **Public Tap:** prepaid credits (non-refundable, 12-month shelf life).  
- **Private Tap:** GPU-hour packs + small monthly base fee.  
- Predictable, easy for procurement, no surprise bills.  
- **Message:** *“Prepaid credits — predictable, no surprises.”*

## USP Summary

**OSS transparency + proof-first robustness + local independent service + prepaid simplicity.**

This combination differentiates us from:

- **Nebius:** scale but not open.  
- **Nebul:** compliance cloud but not OSS plumbing.  
- **UbiOps:** ease of use but not agentic pipelines.  
- **Oracle/OCI:** enterprise trust but not personal/local.

## One-Liner

*“As transparent as open source, as simple as UbiOps, as compliance-aware as Nebul, and as clear on pricing as Nebius — but delivered by your independent AI plumber.”*
