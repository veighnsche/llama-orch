Please be aware that is repo is heavily documented and specs-first development protocol. Please start with reading the .specs or .docs or contracts in the root of the repo. Each crate has specs contracts, readme's and more sorts of docs. all these documents are there for your reference. please adhere to the specs in each crate. if a spec is wrong. please add a spec change proposal in the .specs/proposal. if you work with a todo/checklist. please don't forgot to check off all that you have done.

You have to write down in an *.md file somewhere if you have made stubs or shims. this so that other developers knows what should still be developed, or refactored.
