## 🔄 Narration Paths Documented

### Phase 1: rbee-hive Startup
```
narrate() → stdout → SSH tunnel → queen-rbee → stdout → user shell
```

**Example:**
```
[rbee-hive] 🌅 Starting pool manager on port 9200
[http-server] 🚀 HTTP server ready on port 9200
```

### Phase 2: Worker Startup (HTTP not ready)
```
narrate() → stdout → rbee-hive captures → SSE → queen-rbee → stdout → user shell
```

**Example:**
```
[llm-worker-rbee] 🌅 Worker starting on port 8001
[device-manager] 🖥️ Initialized Metal device 0
[model-loader] 📦 Loading model...
[model-loader] 🛏️ Model loaded! 669 MB cozy in VRAM!
[http-server] 🚀 HTTP server ready on port 8001
```

### Phase 3: Inference (HTTP active)
```
narrate() → SSE → queen-rbee → stdout → user shell
```

**Example:**
```
[candle-backend] 🚀 Starting inference (prompt: 18 chars, max_tokens: 20)
[tokenizer] 🍰 Tokenized prompt (4 tokens)
[candle-backend] 🧹 Reset KV cache for fresh start
[candle-backend] 🎯 Generated 10 tokens
[candle-backend] 🎉 Inference complete! 20 tokens in 150ms (133 tok/s)
```

### Phase 4: Worker Shutdown (HTTP closing)
```
narrate() → stdout → rbee-hive captures → SSE → queen-rbee → stdout → user shell
```

**Example:**
```
[http-server] 👋 Shutting down gracefully
[device-manager] 🧹 Freeing 669 MB VRAM
[llm-worker-rbee] 💤 Worker exiting
```

## ✅ Critical Corrections Applied

### Architecture Corrections

**❌ WRONG (Original):**
- "pool manager dies, worker lives"
- "ctl adds the worker details is last seen alive in the worker registry"
- "ctl runs a health check"
- "ctl runs execute"
- "ctl streams tokens to stdout"

**✅ CORRECT (Updated):**
- **rbee-hive stays alive** (persistent daemon, doesn't die)
- **rbee-hive maintains worker registry** (in-memory, not ctl)
- **queen-rbee orchestrates** (not ctl)
- **rbee-keeper sends execute directly to worker** (bypasses rbee-hive)
- **rbee-keeper displays tokens to stdout, narration to stderr**

### Port Corrections

**❌ WRONG:**
- rbee-hive: port 8080
- workers: port 8081

**✅ CORRECT:**
- rbee-hive: port 9200
- workers: port 8001+

### Narration Audience Correction

**❌ WRONG:**
- "Stdout narration is for pool-manager (operators)"

**✅ CORRECT:**
- "ALL narration is for the USER. Transport varies by HTTP server state."

## 🎯 User Experience Examples Added

### Example 1: Normal Inference
```bash
$ rbee-keeper infer --node mac --model tinyllama --prompt "hello"

[rbee-hive] 🌅 Starting pool manager on port 9200
[llm-worker-rbee] 🌅 Worker starting on port 8001
[model-loader] 📦 Loading model...
[candle-backend] 🚀 Starting inference...
Hello world, this is a test...
[candle-backend] 🎉 Complete! 20 tokens in 150ms

✅ Done!
```

### Example 2: Quiet Mode
```bash
$ rbee-keeper infer --quiet ...

Hello world, this is a test...
```

### Example 3: Piping
```bash
$ rbee-keeper infer ... > output.txt
[candle-backend] 🚀 Starting inference...
[candle-backend] 🎉 Complete!

$ cat output.txt
Hello world, this is a test...
```

## 📚 Key Concepts Documented

### 1. Transport Mechanism
- **Before HTTP ready:** stdout → rbee-hive → SSE → queen-rbee → user
- **During HTTP active:** SSE → queen-rbee → user
- **After HTTP closed:** stdout → rbee-hive → SSE → queen-rbee → user

### 2. Display Rules
- **Narration → stderr** (user sees, doesn't interfere with piping)
- **Tokens → stdout** (AI agent can pipe)

### 3. Optional Narration
- `--quiet` flag disables narration
- Tokens always go to stdout

### 4. Three-Tier Architecture
```
Tier 1: rbee-keeper (displays to user)
Tier 2: queen-rbee (aggregates narration)
Tier 3: rbee-hive + workers (emit narration)
```
