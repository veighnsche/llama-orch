# TEAM-278 rbee-hive Pre-existing Errors Fixed ✅

**Date:** Oct 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Mission:** Fix pre-existing compilation errors in rbee-hive

---

## 🐛 Problem

rbee-hive had pre-existing errors (not related to our deletions):
- Incorrect function imports from `rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle`
- Mismatched struct field access (expecting fields that don't exist)

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Function Imports

**Old (incorrect) imports:**
```rust
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::{spawn_worker, WorkerSpawnConfig};
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::list_worker_processes;
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::get_worker_process;
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::delete_worker;
```

**New (correct) imports:**
```rust
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::{start_worker, WorkerStartConfig};
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::list_workers;
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::get_worker;
use rbee_hive_worker_lifecycle::stop_worker;
```

### 2. Fixed Struct Field Access

**Problem:** `WorkerInfo` only has 3 fields:
- `pid: u32`
- `command: String`
- `args: Vec<String>`

**But job_router was trying to access:**
- `memory_kb` ❌
- `cpu_percent` ❌
- `elapsed` ❌

**Solution:** Simplified output to only use available fields (pid, command)

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `bin/20_rbee_hive/src/job_router.rs`

**Changed:**
1. Line 127: `spawn_worker` → `start_worker`
2. Line 127: `WorkerSpawnConfig` → `WorkerStartConfig`
3. Line 147: `WorkerSpawnConfig` → `WorkerStartConfig`
4. Line 156: `spawn_worker` → `start_worker`
5. Line 173: `list_worker_processes` → `list_workers`
6. Line 182: `list_worker_processes` → `list_workers`
7. Line 216: `get_worker_process` → `get_worker`
8. Line 226: `get_worker_process` → `get_worker`
9. Line 248: `delete_worker` → `stop_worker`
10. Line 260: `delete_worker` → `stop_worker`
11. Lines 198-207: Simplified worker list output (removed memory_kb, cpu_percent, elapsed)
12. Lines 224-231: Simplified worker get output (removed memory_kb, cpu_percent, elapsed)

---

## ✅ Compilation Status

```bash
cargo check -p rbee-hive
# ✅ SUCCESS - Compiles with only 3 warnings (unused constants)
```

**Warnings (non-blocking):**
- Unused constant `ACTION_WORKER_START`
- Unused constant `ACTION_WORKER_LIST`
- Unused constant `ACTION_WORKER_STOP`

These are fine - they're defined for future use.

---

## 📊 Impact

**Lines Changed:** ~15 lines in job_router.rs  
**Errors Fixed:** 4 import errors + 6 field access errors = 10 errors  
**Result:** rbee-hive now compiles successfully

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

The errors were caused by:
1. **Naming mismatch:** worker-lifecycle crate was refactored (TEAM-276) to use consistent naming:
   - `spawn_worker` → `start_worker`
   - `WorkerSpawnConfig` → `WorkerStartConfig`
   - `delete_worker` → `stop_worker`
   - `list_worker_processes` → `list_workers`
   - `get_worker_process` → `get_worker`

2. **Struct simplification:** `WorkerInfo` was simplified to only include essential fields (pid, command, args), but job_router was still expecting process metrics (memory, cpu, elapsed time)

**rbee-hive pre-existing errors fixed. Compilation successful.**
