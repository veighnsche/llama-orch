## The Business Model

### Platform Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ YOUR PLATFORM (Orchestratord-as-a-Service)                   │
│                                                               │
│  Customer-Facing API: api.yourplatform.com                   │
│       ↓                                                       │
│  Your Orchestratord (The Marketplace Engine)                 │
│       ├─→ Home Lab A (orchestratord + 3 GPUs)               │
│       ├─→ Home Lab B (orchestratord + 2 GPUs)               │
│       └─→ Home Lab C (orchestratord + 4 GPUs)               │

```

### Platform Federation Pattern (NOT Nesting)

**Critical Distinction**: This is **federation**, not orchestrator nesting.

```
✅ CORRECT: Platform Federation

Your Platform Orchestratord (api.yourplatform.com)
  ├─→ Provider A's orchestratord (provider-a.internal)
  │    └─→ Their 3 pool-managers → 6 GPUs
  │
  ├─→ Provider B's orchestratord (provider-b.internal)
  │    └─→ Their 2 pool-managers → 4 GPUs
  │
  └─→ Provider C's orchestratord (provider-c.internal)
       └─→ Their 4 pool-managers → 8 GPUs

Platform orchestratord DOES NOT make placement decisions.
It acts as a FACADE that routes to provider orchestrators.

Each provider's orchestratord makes its OWN placement decisions.
The platform matches requests to providers based on: capacity, pricing, SLA.
```

### How Home Labs Connect

**Home Lab Setup** (Provider A example):
```
1. Provider A runs their own orchestratord locally
2. Provider A exposes orchestratord API endpoint
3. Provider A configures: AUTH token, pricing, capacity limits
4. Provider A joins the platform marketplace:
   POST /v2/platform/providers/register
   {
     "provider_id": "provider-a",
     "endpoint": "https://provider-a.example.com",
     "auth_token": "secret",
     "pricing": { "per_token": 0.001, "per_hour": 5.0 },
     "capacity": { "total_gpus": 6, "total_vram_gb": 144 }
   }
```

**Platform Marketplace**:
```
1. Receives customer inference request
2. Queries registered providers: "Who has capacity?"
3. Providers respond with their OWN plans (from their orchestrators)
4. Platform matches request to optimal provider based on:
   - Pricing (customer budget + provider compensation)
   - Capacity (available GPUs)
   - SLA (latency, uptime requirements)
5. Routes customer request to matched provider
6. Bills customer at platform rate
7. Compensates provider at agreed rate
8. Platform fee covers: infrastructure, support, reliability, compliance
```

## Platform Value Propositions (Competitive Advantages)

### 1. Unified API Experience

**Customers benefit from consistent integration**:
- Unified orchestratord API (OpenAPI spec)
- Single integration point for multiple GPU providers
- Stable API reduces ongoing maintenance costs

**Example**:
```typescript
// Customer code (standardized integration)
const client = new OrchestraClient('https://api.yourplatform.com', token);
const result = await client.inference({
  model: 'llama-3.1-70b',
  prompt: 'Hello world',
});

// Integration investment protected by stable API
```

### 2. Curated Model Catalog

**Platform provides vetted, optimized models**:
- Professionally curated model selection
- Consistent versioning across providers
- Quality assurance and performance testing

**Example**:
- Platform offers: `llama-3.1-70b-instruct-q4` (curated, optimized)
- Generic providers offer: `llama-70b` (unoptimized)
- Platform delivers superior performance through expert curation

### 3. Determinism Guarantee (UNIQUE VALUE)

**Platform guarantees: Same seed → Same output**:
- Critical for: AI agents, testing, compliance audits
- Unique capability through controlled infrastructure
- Enables advanced workflows impossible elsewhere

**Platform advantage**:
```
Our platform:
  - Vetted hardware providers
  - Pinned engine versions
  - Sealed VRAM shards (worker-orcd)
  - Deterministic sampling
  Result: GUARANTEED reproducible outputs

Generic providers (e.g., Runpod, Vast.ai):
  - Mixed hardware configurations
  - Variable engine versions
  - Opaque inference stacks
  Result: Non-deterministic outputs
```

### 4. EU Compliance Guarantee (Regulatory Advantage)

**Platform guarantees: EU-only, GDPR-native infrastructure**:
- Geo-verified providers (EU-only GPUs)
- Data sovereignty guarantees
- GDPR-compliant by design

**Value for EU customers**:
- EU regulations require: Data stays in EU
- US-based clouds cannot provide this guarantee
- Platform eliminates compliance risk

## Sustainable Pricing Model

### Platform Fee Structure

```rust
pub struct PricingEngine {
    pub customer_rate: Money,        // Market-competitive pricing
    pub provider_payout: Money,      // Fair provider compensation
    pub platform_fee: Money,         // Service + infrastructure costs
}

impl PricingEngine {
    pub fn calculate_margin(&self, demand: Demand) -> Money {
        match demand {
            Demand::High => {
                // Market-responsive pricing
                let customer_rate = self.base_rate * 1.5;
                let provider_payout = self.base_payout * 1.1;
                customer_rate - provider_payout  // Share upside with providers
            }
            Demand::Low => {
                // Competitive customer pricing
                let customer_rate = self.base_rate * 0.9;
                let provider_payout = self.base_payout * 0.95;
                customer_rate - provider_payout  // Maintain sustainability
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Pricing Tiers

| Customer Tier | Platform Rate | Provider Payout | Platform Fee |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Hobby** | $0.50/hr | $0.30/hr | $0.20/hr (40%) |
| **Startup** | $1.00/hr | $0.60/hr | $0.40/hr (40%) |
| **Enterprise** | $2.00/hr | $1.20/hr | $0.80/hr (40%) |

**Key**: Platform fee covers infrastructure, support, compliance, and reliability guarantees.

## Technical Requirements for Platform Mode

### Must-Have Features

#### 1. Provider Registration API

```rust
// Platform API endpoint
POST /v2/platform/providers/register
{
  "provider_id": "home-lab-123",
  "endpoint": "https://home-lab.example.com",
  "auth_token": "bearer_token_here",
  "pricing": {
    "per_token": 0.0008,
    "per_hour": 4.0,
    "currency": "EUR"
  },
  "capacity": {
    "total_gpus": 6,
    "total_vram_gb": 144,
    "gpu_models": ["RTX 4090", "RTX 4090"]
  },
  "sla": {
    "uptime_guarantee": 0.99,
    "max_latency_ms": 100
  },
  "geo": {
    "country": "NL",
    "region": "EU"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Capacity Discovery

```rust
// Platform queries providers
GET /v2/platform/providers/{id}/capacity

Response:
{
  "provider_id": "home-lab-123",
  "available_gpus": 4,
  "available_vram_gb": 96,
  "queue_depth": 2,
  "estimated_wait_ms": 50
}
```

#### 3. Federated Placement

```rust
pub struct PlatformOrchestrator {
    providers: Vec<RegisteredProvider>,
}

impl PlatformOrchestrator {
    pub async fn place_job(&self, request: InferenceRequest) -> Result<PlacementDecision> {
        // 1. Query all providers for capacity
        let candidates = self.query_providers().await?;
        
        // 2. Calculate value match for each provider
        let scored = candidates.iter().map(|p| {
            let customer_budget = self.customer_pricing(request);
            let provider_cost = p.pricing;
            let platform_fee = customer_budget - provider_cost;
            (p, platform_fee)
        });
        
        // 3. Pick provider with best value + SLA match
        let winner = scored.max_by_key(|(p, _fee)| {
            p.sla.uptime_guarantee  // Prioritize quality
        })?;
        
        // 4. Route to winner's orchestratord
        Ok(PlacementDecision {
            provider: winner.0.clone(),
            endpoint: winner.0.endpoint,
            platform_fee: winner.1,
        })
    }
}
```

#### 4. Billing Integration

```rust
pub struct BillingEngine {
    pub customer_usage: HashMap<CustomerId, Usage>,
    pub provider_payouts: HashMap<ProviderId, Payout>,
}

impl BillingEngine {
    pub fn record_usage(
        &mut self,
        customer: CustomerId,
        provider: ProviderId,
        tokens: usize,
        duration_ms: u64,
    ) {
        // Track customer usage (what you charge)
        self.customer_usage.entry(customer)
            .or_default()
            .add_tokens(tokens, self.customer_rate);
        
        // Track provider payout (fair compensation)
        self.provider_payouts.entry(provider)
            .or_default()
            .add_tokens(tokens, provider.rate);
        
        // Platform fee = difference (covers service costs)
    }
}
```

#### 5. Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

**Critical for platform**: Customer workloads must be isolated.

```rust
pub struct TenantIsolation {
    pub customer_id: String,
    pub vram_limit: usize,
    pub rate_limit: RateLimit,
    pub allowed_models: Vec<String>,
}

// Enforce at admission time
if job.vram_required > tenant.vram_limit {
    return Err("Quota exceeded");
}
```

## Platform Orchestratord: Facade Pattern

### Key Distinction

**This is NOT orchestrator nesting. It's a federation facade.**

```
Your Platform Orchestratord = Smart Router

It does NOT:
  ❌ Make placement decisions for GPUs
  ❌ Manage pools/workers directly
  ❌ Create nested plans

It DOES:
  ✅ Route requests to provider orchestrators
  ✅ Track billing/usage
  ✅ Enforce customer quotas
  ✅ Aggregate capacity from providers
  ✅ Calculate margins
```

### Configuration Example

**Provider's orchestratord config** (runs on their hardware):
```yaml
# config.yaml (provider side)
orchestratord:
  bind: "0.0.0.0:8080"
  auth_token: "provider_secret_token"
  
  # Connect to platform (optional)
  platform:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: "https://api.yourplatform.com"
    provider_id: "home-lab-123"
    registration_token: "platform_registration_secret"
```

**Platform orchestratord config** (your marketplace):
```yaml
# config.yaml (platform side)
orchestratord:
  mode: "platform"  # NEW: Platform federation mode
  bind: "0.0.0.0:443"
  
  providers:
    discovery:
      enabled: true
      registration_endpoint: "/v2/platform/providers/register"
    
    pricing:
      default_margin_percent: 40
      min_margin_percent: 20
      max_margin_percent: 60
```
