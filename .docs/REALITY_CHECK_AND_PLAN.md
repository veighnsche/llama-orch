# Reality Check & High-Level Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Honest Assessment  
**Mood**: Overwhelmed but Focused

---

## The Honest Truth

### What You Have

**✅ Solid Foundation:**
- Comprehensive specs (bin/.specs/00_llama-orch.md - 2350 lines)
- Working worker (llm-worker-rbee - M0 complete)
- Clear architecture (SSH control + HTTP inference)
- Testing infrastructure (BDD, property tests, proof bundles)
- Shared crates (auth-min, audit-logging, deadline-propagation, proof-bundle)
- SDK foundation (llama-orch-sdk for Rust/WASM/npm)
- OpenAPI contracts (contracts/openapi/)

**❌ What's Missing:**
- queen-rbee daemon (scheduling, job queue, SQLite state)
- pool-managerd daemon (worker lifecycle, GPU inventory)
- CLI tools (rbee-keeper, rbee-hive to replace bash scripts)
- Frontend (web UI for conversations)
- Marketing website
- Revenue model implementation
- EU compliance implementation (GDPR, audit logging)

### The Overwhelming Part

**You're trying to build:**
1. Infrastructure (orchestrator, pool manager, CLIs)
2. Developer tooling (better than bash scripts)
3. Production system (multi-tenant, EU-compliant)
4. Marketplace (M5 - provider ecosystem)
5. Frontend (web UI, conversations)
6. Marketing (website, positioning, sales)

**Reality:** This is 2-3 years of work for a team. You're one person, almost broke.

## The Brutal Prioritization

### What Makes Money FIRST

**Option 1: Developer Tool (Homelab Focus)**
- Target: Developers with GPUs at home
- Value: Better than llama.cpp/ollama for multi-GPU setups
- Revenue: $10-50/month per user (self-hosted license)
- Timeline: 3-6 months to MVP
- Competition: llama.cpp (free), ollama (free), LM Studio (free)
- **Problem:** Hard to monetize when competitors are free

**Option 2: Managed Service (Cloud Focus)**
- Target: Businesses needing EU-compliant LLM inference
- Value: GDPR-native, EU-only data residency, audit trails
- Revenue: $0.10-0.50 per 1M tokens (usage-based)
- Timeline: 6-12 months to MVP
- Competition: OpenAI (not EU-native), Anthropic (not EU-native), Mistral (EU but expensive)
- **Advantage:** EU compliance is HARD, you can charge for it

**Option 3: GPU Marketplace (Platform Focus)**
- Target: GPU owners (supply) + businesses (demand)
- Value: Monetize idle GPUs, access to distributed compute
- Revenue: 20-30% platform fee on transactions
- Timeline: 12-18 months to MVP
- Competition: Vast.ai, RunPod, Together.ai
- **Problem:** Chicken-and-egg (need supply AND demand)

### Recommendation: Option 2 (Managed Service)

**Why:**
1. **EU compliance is a moat** - Hard to replicate, high value
2. **B2B pays** - Businesses pay for compliance, not hobbyists
3. **Recurring revenue** - Usage-based pricing scales
4. **You have the tech** - Audit logging, auth-min, deadline-propagation
5. **Clear positioning** - "EU-native LLM inference with full audit trails"

**Target customers:**
- EU healthcare companies (GDPR-critical)
- EU financial services (audit requirements)
- EU government agencies (data sovereignty)
- EU startups (compliance-by-default)

**Pricing:**
- $0.20 per 1M tokens (2x OpenAI, but EU-compliant)
- Audit trail included (competitors charge extra)
- EU-only data residency (no US servers)
- Full GDPR compliance (DPA, data deletion, etc.)

---

## The Focused Plan

### Phase 1: MVP for Revenue (3 months)

**Goal:** Get to $1000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

**Build:**
1. **queen-rbee** (minimal)
   - HTTP API for job submission
   - In-memory job queue (no SQLite yet)
   - Worker registry (in-memory)
   - Direct worker dispatch
   - SSE streaming relay

2. **rbee-hive** (CLI)
   - Model downloads (hf CLI)
   - Worker spawn (llm-worker-rbee)
   - Replace bash scripts

3. **rbee-keeper** (CLI)
   - SSH to pools
   - Job submission via HTTP
   - Status queries

4. **EU Compliance (FEATURE TOGGLE)**
   - `LLORCH_EU_AUDIT=true` enables audit logging
   - `LLORCH_EU_AUDIT=false` disables (for homelab)
   - audit-logging crate (already exists)
   - Immutable event log (append-only)
   - GDPR endpoints (data export, deletion)

5. **Simple Web UI**
   - Job submission form
   - Token streaming display
   - Audit log viewer (if EU mode)
   - No fancy design yet

6. **Marketing Site**
   - Single landing page
   - "EU-Native LLM Inference"
   - Pricing calculator
   - Sign-up form

**Don't build:**
- ❌ pool-managerd daemon (use rbee-hive + SSH)
- ❌ SQLite state (in-memory is fine for MVP)
- ❌ Multi-tenancy (single customer per instance)
- ❌ Marketplace (M5 is too far)
- ❌ Fancy frontend (basic is fine)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-4: queen-rbee + CLIs
- Week 5-6: EU compliance toggle
- Week 7-8: Basic web UI
- Week 9-10: Marketing site
- Week 11-12: First customer onboarding

**Revenue target:**
- 5 customers @ $200/month = $1000 MRR
- Enough to not be broke

### Phase 2: Scale to $10K MRR (6 months)

**Build:**
1. **pool-managerd daemon**
   - Worker lifecycle via HTTP
   - GPU inventory
   - Heartbeat protocol

2. **SQLite state**
   - Job queue persistence
   - Worker registry persistence
   - Audit log persistence

3. **Multi-tenancy**
   - Tenant isolation
   - API keys per tenant
   - Usage tracking per tenant

4. **Better Web UI**
   - React + TailwindCSS
   - Real-time updates
   - Audit trail visualization
   - Usage dashboard

5. **Marketing**
   - SEO content (EU compliance guides)
   - Case studies
   - Partnerships (EU hosting providers)

**Revenue target:**
- 50 customers @ $200/month = $10K MRR
- Enough to hire help

### Phase 3: Scale to $50K MRR (12 months)

**Build:**
1. **Marketplace foundation**
   - GPU provider registration
   - Provider verification
   - Billing integration

2. **Advanced features**
   - Fine-tuning support
   - Custom models
   - Dedicated instances

3. **Enterprise features**
   - SSO integration
   - Custom SLAs
   - Dedicated support

**Revenue target:**
- 250 customers @ $200/month = $50K MRR
- Sustainable business

## Feature Toggles (CRITICAL)

### EU Audit Toggle

**Environment variable:**
```bash
LLORCH_EU_AUDIT=true   # Enable EU compliance features
LLORCH_EU_AUDIT=false  # Disable (homelab mode)
```

**When enabled:**
- ✅ Audit logging to immutable log
- ✅ GDPR endpoints (data export, deletion)
- ✅ Data residency enforcement (EU-only)
- ✅ Consent tracking
- ✅ Retention policies

**When disabled:**
- ❌ No audit logging overhead
- ❌ No GDPR endpoints
- ❌ No data residency checks
- ✅ Faster (no compliance overhead)
- ✅ Simpler (homelab use)

**Implementation:**
```rust
// In queen-rbee
if std::env::var("LLORCH_EU_AUDIT").unwrap_or_default() == "true" {
    // Enable audit logging
    let audit_logger = AuditLogger::new()?;
    middleware.push(AuditMiddleware::new(audit_logger));
    
    // Add GDPR endpoints
    router.route("/gdpr/export", get(gdpr_export));
    router.route("/gdpr/delete", post(gdpr_delete));
}
```

### Update Method Toggle

**Environment variable:**
```bash
LLORCH_UPDATE_METHOD=git     # Update via git pull (current)
LLORCH_UPDATE_METHOD=binary  # Update via binary download (future)
```

**When git:**
```bash
# Update via git (current method)
cd ~/Projects/llama-orch
git pull
git submodule update --recursive
cargo build --release
```

**When binary:**
```bash
# Update via binary download (future)
curl -L https://releases.llama-orch.com/latest/rbee-keeper -o rbee-keeper
chmod +x rbee-keeper
```

**Implementation:**
```rust
// In rbee-keeper
match std::env::var("LLORCH_UPDATE_METHOD").unwrap_or("git".to_string()).as_str() {
    "git" => {
        // git pull + cargo build
        Command::new("git").args(&["pull"]).status()?;
        Command::new("cargo").args(&["build", "--release"]).status()?;
    }
    "binary" => {
        // Download latest binary
        let url = "https://releases.llama-orch.com/latest/rbee-keeper";
        download_and_replace(url, current_exe()?)?;
    }
    _ => return Err("Invalid LLORCH_UPDATE_METHOD"),
}
```
