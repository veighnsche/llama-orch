## TEAM-122: Fix Panics + Final Integration (4 hours)

**Deliverable:** Fix all 104 panic failures + verify final pass rate

**Tasks:**

### Part 1: Fix Panics (3 hours)
1. Identify all panicking steps (30 min)
2. Add proper error handling to each (2 hours)
3. Replace `unwrap()` with `?` or `expect()` with context (30 min)

**Common Panic Causes:**
- Unwrapping None values
- Index out of bounds
- Failed assertions without proper error messages
- Missing fields in test data

**Files to Review:**
- All step definition files
- Focus on steps that access `world` state
- Focus on steps that parse responses

### Part 2: Final Integration (1 hour)
1. Run full test suite
2. Verify 270+/300 passing (90%+)
3. Document remaining failures
4. Create summary report

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero panics in test runs
- 90%+ pass rate achieved
- Clear documentation of any remaining failures
- Completion report ready

## Coordination & Dependencies

### No Dependencies Between Teams
- Each team works independently
- No merge conflicts (different files/functions)
- Can work in parallel

### Integration Points
- TEAM-122 waits for all others to complete
- TEAM-122 does final verification
- All teams commit to their own branches

### Branch Strategy
```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ fix/team-117-ambiguous-steps
â”œâ”€â”€ fix/team-118-missing-batch-1
â”œâ”€â”€ fix/team-119-missing-batch-2
â”œâ”€â”€ fix/team-120-missing-batch-3
â”œâ”€â”€ fix/team-121-missing-batch-4-timeouts
â””â”€â”€ fix/team-122-panics-final
```

**Merge Order:**
1. TEAM-117 (ambiguous steps) - merge first
2. TEAM-118, 119, 120, 121 (parallel) - merge after 117
3. TEAM-122 (panics + final) - merge last

---

## Timeline

### Day 1 (8 hours)
- **Hour 0-4:** Teams 117, 118, 119 work in parallel
- **Hour 4-8:** Teams 120, 121 work in parallel
- **End of Day:** 5 teams complete, ready for integration

### Day 2 (4 hours)
- **Hour 0-3:** TEAM-122 fixes panics
- **Hour 3-4:** TEAM-122 final verification
- **End of Day:** 90%+ pass rate achieved

**Total:** 28 team-hours = 2 days with 6 teams

---

## Success Metrics

### Target Outcomes
- âœ… **Zero ambiguous steps**
- âœ… **Zero unimplemented steps**
- âœ… **Zero unexpected timeouts** (integration tests skip gracefully)
- âœ… **Zero panics**
- âœ… **270+/300 tests passing (90%+)**

### Acceptable Remaining Failures
- Complex integration scenarios requiring full infrastructure
- Edge cases that need specific hardware (GPU, etc.)
- Performance tests that need load generation

**Maximum acceptable failures:** 30/300 (10%)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Teams finish at different speeds
**Mitigation:** TEAM-122 can help slower teams

### Risk 2: Merge conflicts
**Mitigation:** Different files per team, clear boundaries

### Risk 3: Tests still fail after implementation
**Mitigation:** TEAM-122 has buffer time for fixes

### Risk 4: Scope creep
**Mitigation:** Strict task lists, no additions

---

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups
- Morning: Each team reports progress
- Evening: Each team reports completion status

### Blockers
- Report immediately in shared channel
- TEAM-122 (integration team) helps unblock

### Completion Criteria
- All tasks in team's list complete
- Tests compile
- No new errors introduced
- Branch pushed and ready for review

---

## Deliverables

### Each Team Delivers
1. **Code:** All implementations complete
2. **Tests:** All tests passing for their scope
3. **Documentation:** Brief summary of changes
4. **Branch:** Clean, ready to merge

### Final Deliverable (TEAM-122)
1. **Test Report:** Final pass rate (target: 90%+)
2. **Summary Document:** What was fixed, what remains
3. **Recommendations:** Next steps for remaining failures
