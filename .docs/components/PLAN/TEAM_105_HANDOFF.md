**Key Achievement:** Complete cascading shutdown implementation from queen-rbee down to all workers across all hives, with parallel execution, timeout enforcement, detailed audit logging, and BDD step definitions for testing.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Parallel Worker Shutdown ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:** `bin/rbee-hive/src/commands/daemon.rs`

**Features:**
- Concurrent shutdown of all workers using `tokio::spawn`
- Progress tracking with real-time metrics (graceful/forced/timeout counts)
- Graceful HTTP shutdown attempt followed by force-kill if needed
- Per-worker shutdown status reporting

**Key Code:**
```rust
// TEAM-105: Parallel shutdown with progress tracking
let mut shutdown_tasks = Vec::new();

for worker in workers {
    let task = tokio::spawn(async move {
        // Try graceful shutdown via HTTP
        let graceful_success = match shutdown_worker(&worker_url).await {
            Ok(_) => true,
            Err(e) => false,
        };
        
        // Force-kill if worker doesn't respond
        if let Some(pid) = worker_pid {
            force_kill_worker_if_needed(pid, &worker_id).await;
        }
        
        (worker_id, graceful_success)
    });
    
    shutdown_tasks.push(task);
}
```

**Progress Metrics:**
- Total workers
- Graceful shutdowns
- Forced shutdowns
- Timeout aborts
- Total duration

---

### 2. Queen → Hives SSH Shutdown ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:** `bin/queen-rbee/src/main.rs`

**Features:**
- Parallel SSH shutdown to all registered hives
- Finds rbee-hive daemon PID via `pgrep -f 'rbee-hive daemon'`
- Sends SIGTERM to each hive daemon
- Verifies shutdown success via SSH command execution
- Handles hives where daemon is not running gracefully

**Key Code:**
```rust
// TEAM-105: Shutdown all registered hives via SSH
async fn shutdown_all_hives(beehive_registry: Arc<beehive_registry::BeehiveRegistry>) {
    let hives = beehive_registry.list_nodes().await?;
    
    // Parallel shutdown of all hives
    for hive in hives {
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            // Find rbee-hive daemon PID
            let find_pid_cmd = "pgrep -f 'rbee-hive daemon'";
            let (success, stdout, _) = ssh::execute_remote_command(...).await?;
            
            if success && !stdout.trim().is_empty() {
                let pid = stdout.trim();
                // Send SIGTERM
                let kill_cmd = format!("kill -TERM {}", pid);
                ssh::execute_remote_command(...).await?;
            }
        });
    }
}
```

**SSH Integration:**
- Uses existing `ssh::execute_remote_command()` function
- Supports SSH key authentication
- 10s connection timeout per hive
- Graceful handling of unreachable hives

---

### 3. Timeout & Force-Kill ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:** Both `rbee-hive` and `queen-rbee`

**Features:**
- **30-second total timeout** for all shutdown operations
- Per-task timeout enforcement using `tokio::time::timeout`
- Automatic task abort when global timeout exceeded
- Force-kill remaining workers/hives after timeout
- Detailed audit logging with duration tracking

**Timeout Logic:**
```rust
// TEAM-105: Wait for all shutdowns with 30s timeout
let shutdown_start = Instant::now();

for task in shutdown_tasks {
    let elapsed = shutdown_start.elapsed();
    let remaining = Duration::from_secs(30).saturating_sub(elapsed);
    
    if remaining.is_zero() {
        // Timeout exceeded - abort remaining tasks
        error!("Shutdown timeout (30s) exceeded - aborting remaining");
        timeout_count += 1;
        task.abort();
        continue;
    }
    
    match tokio::time::timeout(remaining, task).await {
        Ok(Ok(success)) => { /* Task completed */ }
        Ok(Err(e)) => { /* Task failed */ }
        Err(_) => { /* Task timed out */ }
    }
}
```

**Audit Logging:**
```rust
// TEAM-105: SHUTDOWN AUDIT
info!(
    "SHUTDOWN AUDIT - Total: {}, Graceful: {}, Forced: {}, Timeout: {}, Duration: {:.2}s",
    total_workers, graceful_count, forced_count, timeout_count, total_duration.as_secs_f64()
);
```

## Shutdown Flow

### Complete Cascading Shutdown Sequence

1. **User sends SIGTERM/SIGINT to queen-rbee**
   - Ctrl+C or `kill -TERM <pid>`

2. **Queen-rbee initiates cascading shutdown**
   - Calls `shutdown_all_hives()` with 30s timeout
   - Spawns parallel SSH tasks for each registered hive

3. **For each hive (parallel execution):**
   - SSH to hive: `pgrep -f 'rbee-hive daemon'`
   - If daemon found: `kill -TERM <pid>`
   - Log success/failure

4. **Each rbee-hive daemon receives SIGTERM**
   - Calls `shutdown_all_workers()` with 30s timeout
   - Spawns parallel shutdown tasks for each worker

5. **For each worker (parallel execution):**
   - Try graceful HTTP: `POST /v1/shutdown` (5s timeout)
   - Wait 10s for graceful exit
   - If still running: `kill -KILL <pid>` (force-kill)

6. **Progress tracking and audit logging**
   - Real-time progress metrics
   - Final audit log with counts and duration
   - Warnings for timeout violations

## Integration Notes

### For TEAM-106 (Integration Testing)

**Testing Cascading Shutdown:**

1. **Setup multi-hive environment:**
   ```bash
   # Start queen-rbee
   cargo run --bin queen-rbee -- --port 8080
   
   # Register hives
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/beehives \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"node_name": "workstation", "ssh_host": "workstation.home.arpa", ...}'
   
   # Start rbee-hive daemons on each hive
   ssh workstation.home.arpa "cd ~/rbee && cargo run --bin rbee-hive daemon"
   ```

2. **Spawn workers on hives:**
   ```bash
   # Via queen-rbee API or direct rbee-hive API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/workers/spawn \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model_ref": "...", "backend": "cuda", ...}'
   ```

3. **Test cascading shutdown:**
   ```bash
   # Send SIGTERM to queen-rbee
   kill -TERM $(pgrep -f 'queen-rbee')
   
   # Observe logs:
   # - Queen-rbee sends SSH SIGTERM to all hives
   # - Each hive shuts down its workers in parallel
   # - Progress metrics logged
   # - Final audit log shows totals
   ```

4. **Verify timeout enforcement:**
   ```bash
   # Block a worker from shutting down (simulate hang)
   # Verify it gets force-killed after timeout
   # Check audit log shows timeout count > 0
   ```

**Expected Behavior:**
- All workers shutdown within 30s (graceful or forced)
- All hives receive SIGTERM within 30s
- Audit logs show complete shutdown metrics
- No zombie processes left behind

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Parallel Shutdown is Critical for Performance

Sequential shutdown of 10+ workers would take 100+ seconds (10s per worker). Parallel execution completes in ~10-15s total.

### 2. Timeout Enforcement Prevents Hung Shutdowns

Without timeout, a single hung worker could block shutdown indefinitely. The 30s timeout ensures clean exit.

### 3. Audit Logging Provides Visibility

Detailed shutdown metrics help diagnose issues:
- Which workers failed gracefully?
- How many timeouts occurred?
- What was the total duration?

### 4. SSH Shutdown Cascade is Robust

Using `pgrep` + `kill -TERM` is more reliable than assuming daemon PID. Handles cases where daemon is not running gracefully.

### 5. Generic Types Solve Import Cycles

Using `update_download_metrics<T>(_download_tracker: Arc<T>)` avoids circular dependency between metrics and download_tracker modules.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No retry logic for SSH failures**
   - If SSH connection fails, hive is marked as failed
   - Future enhancement: retry SSH connection 2-3 times

2. **No verification of worker process exit**
   - After force-kill, we don't verify process actually exited
   - Future enhancement: poll process table after SIGKILL

3. **Fixed 30s timeout**
   - Timeout is hardcoded, not configurable
   - Future enhancement: make timeout configurable via env var

4. **No graceful degradation for partial failures**
   - If some hives fail, shutdown continues
   - But no mechanism to retry or escalate

**Note to TEAM-106:**

1. **Parallel shutdown is READY** - Workers shutdown concurrently
2. **SSH cascade is READY** - Queen-rbee sends SIGTERM to all hives
3. **Timeout enforcement is READY** - 30s timeout with force-kill
4. **Audit logging is READY** - Detailed shutdown metrics
5. **Test multi-hive environment** - Verify cascading shutdown across multiple nodes
6. **Test timeout scenarios** - Simulate hung workers/hives
7. **Verify no zombie processes** - Check process table after shutdown

**Integration Test Ideas:**
- 3-hive cluster with 5 workers each (15 total workers)
- Shutdown should complete in < 30s
- All workers should be gracefully or force-killed
- All hives should receive SIGTERM
- Audit logs should show complete metrics
- No zombie processes should remain

**Chaos Test Ideas:**
- Block one worker's shutdown endpoint (simulate hang)
- Disconnect SSH to one hive (simulate network failure)
- Kill one worker mid-shutdown (simulate crash)
- Verify timeout enforcement and audit logging
