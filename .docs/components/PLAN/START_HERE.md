## Getting Started

### For BDD Test Teams (TEAM-097 to TEAM-100)

## Communication

### Handoff Protocol

Each team MUST create a handoff document:
- **File:** `PLAN/TEAM_XXX_HANDOFF.md`
- **Max Length:** 2 pages
- **Required Sections:**
  - What was completed (with evidence)
  - Test results (pass/fail counts)
  - Known issues
  - Next team's priorities

### Progress Tracking

Update your team file daily with:
- [ ] Checklist progress (X/N format)
- [ ] Test pass rate (if applicable)
- [ ] Blockers (if any)
- [ ] Questions for next team

---

## Rules & Guidelines

### From Engineering Rules (MANDATORY)

1. **Complete previous team's TODO list** - Don't invent new priorities
2. **Add TEAM-XXX signatures** - New files: `// Created by: TEAM-XXX`
3. **No background testing** - Always foreground, see full output
4. **No TODO markers** - Implement or delete, don't defer
5. **Update existing docs** - Don't create multiple .md files for one task
6. **Handoffs ‚â§ 2 pages** - With code examples and progress

### BDD Testing Rules

1. **10+ functions minimum** - Calling real product APIs
2. **No TODO markers** - Implement or ask for help
3. **Test REAL code** - Import from `/bin/`, not mocks
4. **Show progress** - Function count, API calls, test pass rate

### Quality Standards

- **Code:** No unwrap/expect in production paths
- **Tests:** 80%+ coverage for each feature
- **Docs:** Update component docs after changes
- **Security:** Use shared crates (auth-min, secrets-management, etc.)

---

## Estimated Effort

| Phase | Teams | Duration | Scenarios/Items |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **BDD Tests** | 4 teams | 20-28 days | 100+ scenarios |
| **Implementation** | 5 teams | 15-20 days | 18 RC items |
| **Integration** | 3 teams | 10-15 days | Full validation |
| **Total** | 12 teams | 45-63 days | Production ready |

**Parallel Work:** BDD teams can work concurrently (4 teams √ó 5-7 days each)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- Worker PID tracking (complex, touches core lifecycle)
- Authentication (must not break existing functionality)
- Cascading shutdown (parallel implementation needed)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Write comprehensive BDD tests FIRST
- Implement incrementally (one test at a time)
- Run full test suite after each change
- Keep implementation teams small (focused work)

---

## Questions?

**Before starting work:**
1. Read your team assignment file completely
2. Read related component documentation
3. Read BDD test specifications (if implementation team)
4. Check previous team's handoff (if not first team)

**During work:**
- Document blockers immediately
- Ask questions in handoff document
- Update progress daily

**After completing work:**
- Create handoff document (‚â§ 2 pages)
- Show actual progress (not TODO lists)
- Verify all tests pass
