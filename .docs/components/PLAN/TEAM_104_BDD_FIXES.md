# TEAM-104 BDD Test Fixes

**Created by:** TEAM-104 | 2025-10-18  
**Purpose:** Fix BDD tests broken by TEAM-103's restart field additions  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All WorkerInfo field errors fixed

---

## Problem

TEAM-103 added `restart_count` and `last_restart` fields to `WorkerInfo` struct but broke the BDD tests. Multiple test files had WorkerInfo constructions missing these new fields, causing compilation errors.

**Initial Error Count:** 21 E0063 errors (missing fields)

---

## Solution

Fixed all WorkerInfo constructions in BDD test files by adding the missing fields:
- `restart_count: 0` - Initialize to 0 (no restarts yet)
- `last_restart: None` - Initialize to None (never restarted)

---

## Files Fixed

1. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/worker_registration.rs` - 1 instance
2. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/lifecycle.rs` - 1 instance
3. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/pid_tracking.rs` - 2 instances
4. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/worker_health.rs` - 2 instances (auto-fixed by script)
5. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/happy_path.rs` - 2 instances
6. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/registry.rs` - 1 instance
7. ✅ `test-harness/bdd/src/steps/worker_startup.rs` - 1 instance

**Total:** 10 WorkerInfo constructions fixed across 7 files

---

## Verification

```bash
cd test-harness/bdd && cargo build 2>&1 | grep "E0063"
```

**Result:** ✅ No E0063 errors (missing fields)

All WorkerInfo field errors are resolved. The BDD test suite still has 11 pre-existing errors unrelated to TEAM-104's work:
- E0382: Borrow checker issues (pre-existing)
- E0433: Missing `shellexpand` crate (pre-existing)
- E0599: Missing `CaptureAdapter::drain` method (pre-existing)

These pre-existing errors are NOT caused by TEAM-104 and should be addressed separately.

---

## Code Signature

All fixes marked with `// TEAM-104: Added restart tracking` comments.
