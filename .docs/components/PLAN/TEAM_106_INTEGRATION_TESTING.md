# TEAM-106: Integration Testing

**Phase:** 3 - Integration & Validation  
**Duration:** 1 day (completed)  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Mission

Validate complete system integration:
1. Full stack integration tests
2. End-to-end flows
3. Component interaction testing
4. Regression testing

**Prerequisite:** ALL implementation teams (TEAM-101 to TEAM-105) complete

---

## Tasks

### 1. Full Stack Tests (Day 1-3)
- [ ] Test queen → hive → worker flow
- [ ] Test authentication end-to-end
- [ ] Test cascading shutdown
- [ ] Test failure recovery
- [ ] Test concurrent operations

---

### 2. Integration Scenarios (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Multi-hive deployment
- [ ] Worker churn (rapid spawn/shutdown)
- [ ] Network partitions
- [ ] Database failures
- [ ] OOM scenarios

---

### 3. Regression Testing (Day 6-7)
- [ ] Run ALL BDD tests (100+ scenarios)
- [ ] Verify 100% pass rate
- [ ] Check code coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory leak detection

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 100+ BDD scenarios pass
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] Full stack flows work

---

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all BDD tests
LLORCH_BDD_FEATURE_PATH=test-harness/bdd/tests/features \
  cargo run --bin bdd-runner

# Generate coverage
cargo tarpaulin --all --out Html

# Memory leak detection
valgrind --leak-check=full cargo run --bin queen-rbee

# Performance benchmarks
cargo bench
```
