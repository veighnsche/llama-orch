# TEAM-113 Handoff to Week 2 Team

**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**From:** TEAM-113  
**To:** Week 2 implementation team

---

## ‚úÖ What We Completed

### Week 1 Work (3 hours instead of 3-4 days)
1. ‚úÖ Error handling audit - **Production code is already excellent, no fixes needed**
2. ‚úÖ Identified 87 missing BDD steps (deferred - focus on wiring libraries instead)
3. ‚úÖ Added audit logging to queen-rbee (1 hour)
4. ‚úÖ Wired input validation to rbee-keeper and queen-rbee
5. ‚úÖ Verified PID tracking already exists (TEAM-101 did it)
6. ‚úÖ Implemented force_kill_worker() for graceful shutdown

### Documentation Created
- `ORCHESTRATOR_STANDARDS.md` - What rbee already does (rbee IS the orchestrator)
- `WEEK_1_COMPLETE.md` - Week 1 summary
- `ERROR_HANDLING_AUDIT.md` - Production code analysis
- Updated all weekly checklists

## üö® CRITICAL: What We Did WRONG

### 1. Made Up Features rbee Doesn't Have
**What we did:** Said "rbee is GPU-only by design"  
**Reality:** rbee has BOTH GPU and CPU workers (user chooses)  
**Lesson:** DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - verify in the code first

### 2. Suggested Features rbee Doesn't Need
**What we did:** Referenced Kubernetes health probes, deployments, patterns  
**Reality:** rbee IS the orchestrator, not an app running IN Kubernetes  
**Lesson:** rbee doesn't need Kubernetes - we ARE the simple alternative

### 3. Created Bloated Documentation
**What we did:** 400+ lines of "analysis" for a 2-line fix  
**Reality:** Just fix it, don't write a novel about it  
**Lesson:** Code > documentation. Fix first, document if actually needed.

### 4. Referenced Industry Standards Wrong
**What we did:** "You should do X like Kubernetes/GPUStack"  
**Reality:** Document what rbee ALREADY DOES, not what it should do  
**Lesson:** rbee already follows standards - just document them

### 5. Suggested Automatic CPU Fallback
**What we did:** Mentioned CPU fallback as if rbee should do it  
**Reality:** rbee has CPU workers, but NO automatic fallback (user chooses)  
**Lesson:** NO FALLBACKS - user explicitly chooses worker type

## ‚úÖ What We Learned

### 1. rbee IS the Orchestrator
- **queen-rbee** = Control plane (API server, scheduler, registry)
- **rbee-hive** = Node manager (spawns workers, monitors health)
- **llm-worker-rbee** = Worker process (runs inference)
- We don't need Kubernetes - we ARE the orchestrator

### 2. Focus on What Exists
- Audit logging library EXISTS - just wire it
- Deadline propagation library EXISTS - just wire it
- Auth library EXISTS - just wire it
- Don't rebuild, just connect

### 3. Production Code is Already Good
- Zero unwrap/expect in critical paths
- Proper Result propagation
- Error handling already follows best practices
- Don't fix what isn't broken

### 4. Simple Over Complex
- rbee is simple by design
- Don't add enterprise complexity
- Don't add Kubernetes patterns
- Keep it focused on inference

## üìã Week 2 Checklist - What to Actually Do

### Priority 1: Wire Audit Logging (3-4 hours)
**Files:**
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/main.rs` - Initialize AuditLogger (copy from queen-rbee)
- `bin/queen-rbee/src/http/middleware/auth.rs` - Log auth events
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/http/middleware/auth.rs` - Log auth events

**Pattern:** Same as queen-rbee (disabled by default, env var to enable)

### Priority 2: Wire Deadline Propagation (1 day)
**Files:**
- `bin/rbee-hive/Cargo.toml` - Add deadline-propagation dependency
- `bin/queen-rbee/src/http/inference.rs` - Add deadline headers
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/http/workers.rs` - Propagate deadline, implement timeout

**Pattern:** Extract deadline from request, propagate to next hop, cancel on timeout

### Priority 3: Wire Auth to llm-worker-rbee (1 day)
**Files:**
- `bin/llm-worker-rbee/Cargo.toml` - Add auth-min dependency
- `bin/llm-worker-rbee/src/http/middleware/auth.rs` - Copy from queen-rbee
- `bin/llm-worker-rbee/src/main.rs` - Load token, add middleware

**Pattern:** Exact same as queen-rbee and rbee-hive

### Priority 4: Worker Restart Policy (2-3 days)
**Files:**
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/config.rs` - Add RestartPolicy config
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/restart.rs` - NEW FILE - Exponential backoff logic
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/registry.rs` - Track restart_count (field already exists!)

**Pattern:** Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s), max 3 attempts, circuit breaker

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### DON'T Add These Features
- ‚ùå Automatic CPU fallback (user chooses worker type)
- ‚ùå Kubernetes health probes (we're not in Kubernetes)
- ‚ùå RBAC (not in v0.1.0 scope)
- ‚ùå OpenTelemetry tracing (not needed yet)
- ‚ùå Cloud-native patterns (we're cloud-agnostic)

### DON'T Reference These
- ‚ùå Kubernetes patterns (we're the orchestrator, not the orchestrated)
- ‚ùå "Industry standards you should follow" (document what we already do)
- ‚ùå Feature suggestions (just implement the checklist)

### DON'T Create These
- ‚ùå 100+ line analysis documents for simple changes
- ‚ùå "Standards reference" documents full of suggestions
- ‚ùå Documents about what you're going to do (just do it)

---

## ‚úÖ What TO Do

### DO Wire Existing Libraries
- ‚úÖ audit-logging (exists, just initialize it)
- ‚úÖ deadline-propagation (exists, just add headers)
- ‚úÖ auth-min (exists, just copy middleware)

### DO Follow Existing Patterns
- ‚úÖ Copy from queen-rbee (it works)
- ‚úÖ Use same config pattern (env vars, disabled by default)
- ‚úÖ Follow TEAM-102 auth pattern

### DO Keep It Simple
- ‚úÖ Wire libraries, don't rebuild
- ‚úÖ Copy working code
- ‚úÖ Test it works
- ‚úÖ Move on

---

## üìä Current Status

### Completed (TEAM-113)
- ‚úÖ Input validation wired (rbee-keeper, queen-rbee)
- ‚úÖ PID tracking verified (already exists)
- ‚úÖ force_kill_worker() implemented
- ‚úÖ Audit logging wired to queen-rbee
- ‚úÖ Error handling audited (already excellent)

### Ready for Week 2
- ‚è≥ Wire audit logging to rbee-hive (3-4 hours)
- ‚è≥ Wire deadline propagation (1 day)
- ‚è≥ Wire auth to llm-worker-rbee (1 day)
- ‚è≥ Implement restart policy (2-3 days)

### Tests Passing
- Current: ~85-90/300 (28-30%)
- Week 2 target: ~130-150/300 (43-50%)

## üéØ Key Reminders

1. **rbee IS the orchestrator** - We don't need Kubernetes
2. **Wire existing libraries** - Don't rebuild from scratch
3. **Copy working patterns** - queen-rbee auth works, copy it
4. **Keep it simple** - No enterprise complexity
5. **No automatic fallback** - User chooses worker type
6. **Document what exists** - Not what should exist
7. **Code > docs** - Just implement, don't over-document

- `ORCHESTRATOR_STANDARDS.md` - What rbee already does
- `WEEK_2_CHECKLIST.md` - Your tasks
- `WEEK_1_COMPLETE.md` - What we did

- `bin/queen-rbee/src/main.rs` - Audit logger initialization
- `bin/queen-rbee/src/http/middleware/auth.rs` - Auth pattern
- `bin/rbee-hive/src/registry.rs` - WorkerInfo has restart_count field

### Libraries to Use
- `bin/shared-crates/audit-logging/` - Audit logging
- `bin/shared-crates/deadline-propagation/` - Deadline propagation

## üöÄ Good Luck!

**Remember:**
- Wire libraries (don't rebuild)
- Copy patterns (don't reinvent)
- Keep it simple (don't over-engineer)
- rbee is the orchestrator (not Kubernetes)

**You've got this!**
