# Week 2 Summary - TEAM-113

**Week:** 2 of 4  
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS  
**Date:** 2025-10-18

---

## 🎯 Week 2 Goal

**Goal:** Wire existing libraries, add worker lifecycle features  
**Target:** ~130-150/300 tests passing (43-50%)

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Priority 1: Wire Audit Logging ✅ PARTIAL
**Status:** 🟢 **queen-rbee COMPLETE**, 🟡 **rbee-hive PENDING**  
**Time Spent:** 1 hour

**Completed:**
- ✅ Added audit-logging dependency to queen-rbee/Cargo.toml
- ✅ Verified rbee-hive already has audit-logging dependency
- ✅ Initialized AuditLogger in queen-rbee startup
- ✅ Configured for home lab mode (disabled by default, zero overhead)
- ✅ Added env var support (LLORCH_AUDIT_MODE=local to enable)
- ✅ Compiles successfully

**Configuration:**
```rust
// Disabled by default for home lab mode
// Set LLORCH_AUDIT_MODE=local to enable file-based audit logging
// Set LLORCH_AUDIT_DIR=/path/to/logs to customize location
```

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Initialize AuditLogger in rbee-hive startup
- [ ] Add audit events to auth middleware (log success/failure)
- [ ] Add audit events to worker lifecycle (spawn/shutdown)
- [ ] Add audit events to configuration changes

**Impact:** Compliance features ready, security audit trail available when needed

## ⏳ Pending Tasks

### Priority 2: Wire Deadline Propagation (1 day)
**Status:** ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Steps:**
- [ ] Add deadline-propagation dependency to rbee-hive
- [ ] Add deadline headers to HTTP requests (queen-rbee → rbee-hive)
- [ ] Add deadline headers to HTTP requests (rbee-hive → workers)
- [ ] Implement timeout cancellation in inference chain

### Priority 3: Wire Auth to llm-worker-rbee (1 day)
**Status:** ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Steps:**
- [ ] Copy auth middleware from queen-rbee
- [ ] Add to worker HTTP routes
- [ ] Test with invalid tokens

### Priority 4: Worker Restart Policy (2-3 days)
**Status:** ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff
- [ ] Add max restart attempts
- [ ] Add circuit breaker
- [ ] Track restart count (field already exists!)

### Week 2 Goals vs Actual

| Goal | Target | Actual | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Audit logging | All components | 1/3 (queen-rbee) | 🟡 PARTIAL |
| Deadline propagation | End-to-end | Not started | ⏳ PENDING |
| Auth to workers | Complete | Not started | ⏳ PENDING |
| Restart policy | Implemented | Not started | ⏳ PENDING |
| Tests passing | 130-150/300 | ~85-90/300 | ⏳ PENDING |

### Time Analysis

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Audit logging | 1 day | 1 hour | 🟢 AHEAD |
| Deadline propagation | 1 day | - | ⏳ PENDING |
| Auth to workers | 1 day | - | ⏳ PENDING |
| Restart policy | 2-3 days | - | ⏳ PENDING |
| **Total Week 2** | 5-6 days | 1 hour | 🟡 IN PROGRESS |

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Audit logging library is excellent** - Well-designed, zero overhead when disabled
2. **Home lab mode by default** - Disabled audit logging for personal use (zero overhead)
3. **Env var configuration** - Easy to enable for compliance needs
4. **rbee-hive already has dependency** - Less work than expected

---

## 🎁 Deliverables

### Code Changes
1. ✅ `bin/queen-rbee/Cargo.toml` - Added audit-logging + deadline-propagation dependencies
2. ✅ `bin/queen-rbee/src/main.rs` - Initialized AuditLogger with env var support
3. ✅ Compiles successfully

### Documentation
1. ✅ `WEEK_2_PROGRESS.md` - Progress tracking
2. ✅ `WEEK_2_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Continue Week 2)
1. Wire audit logging to rbee-hive startup
2. Add audit events to auth middleware
3. Add audit events to worker lifecycle
4. Wire deadline propagation
5. Wire auth to llm-worker-rbee
6. Implement worker restart policy

### Estimated Remaining Time
- Audit logging completion: 3-4 hours
- Deadline propagation: 1 day
- Auth to workers: 1 day
- Restart policy: 2-3 days
- **Total:** 4-5 days remaining in Week 2

## 📈 Impact Assessment

### Before Week 2
- Tests passing: ~85-90/300 (28-30%)
- Audit logging: Not wired
- Deadline propagation: Not wired
- Auth coverage: 67% (2/3 components)

### After Week 2 (Projected)
- Tests passing: ~130-150/300 (43-50%)
- Audit logging: 100% wired
- Deadline propagation: 100% wired
- Auth coverage: 100% (3/3 components)
- Worker restart policy: Implemented

---

**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS - 1 hour spent, 4-5 days remaining  
**Quality:** 🟢 GOOD - Clean implementation, zero overhead by default  
**Recommendation:** Continue with remaining Week 2 priorities
