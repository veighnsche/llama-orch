# Week 2 Progress: Reliability Features

**Team:** TEAM-113 (continuing)  
**Week:** 2 of 4  
**Goal:** Wire existing libraries, add worker lifecycle features  
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS

---

## 📋 Tasks Overview

### Priority 1: Wire Audit Logging (1 day)
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Add audit-logging dependency to queen-rbee/Cargo.toml
2. ✅ Add audit-logging dependency to rbee-hive/Cargo.toml (already exists!)
3. ⏳ Initialize audit logger in queen-rbee startup
4. ⏳ Initialize audit logger in rbee-hive startup
5. ⏳ Log authentication events (success/failure)
6. ⏳ Log worker spawn/shutdown events
7. ⏳ Log configuration changes

**Impact:** Compliance features enabled, security audit trail

### Priority 2: Wire Deadline Propagation (1 day)
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

**Steps:**
- [ ] Add deadline-propagation dependency to queen-rbee
- [ ] Add deadline-propagation dependency to rbee-hive
- [ ] Add deadline headers to HTTP requests (queen-rbee → rbee-hive)
- [ ] Add deadline headers to HTTP requests (rbee-hive → workers)
- [ ] Implement timeout cancellation in inference chain
- [ ] Add deadline tracking to worker registry

**Impact:** Timeout handling, better request cancellation

---

### Priority 3: Wire Auth to llm-worker-rbee (1 day)
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

**Steps:**
- [ ] Copy auth middleware from queen-rbee
- [ ] Add to worker HTTP routes
- [ ] Test with invalid tokens
- [ ] Update worker startup to load API token

**Impact:** Complete authentication coverage (100%)

---

### Priority 4: Worker Restart Policy (2-3 days)
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s)
- [ ] Add max restart attempts (default: 3)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker (stop after N failures in M minutes)
- [ ] Track restart count in WorkerInfo (field already exists!)
- [ ] Add restart metrics
- [ ] Test restart scenarios

**Impact:** Resilient workers, automatic recovery

---

## 🎯 Week 2 Goals

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Audit logging active on all components
- [ ] Deadline propagation working end-to-end
- [ ] Authentication on all 3 components (100%)
- [ ] Worker restart policy implemented
- [ ] ~130-150/300 tests passing (43-50%)

**Current Status:**
- Tests passing: ~85-90/300 (28-30%)
- Target: 130-150/300 (43-50%)
- Improvement needed: +45-65 tests

## 📝 Work Log

### 2025-10-18 - TEAM-113

**Completed:**
- ✅ Added audit-logging dependency to queen-rbee
- ✅ Added deadline-propagation dependency to queen-rbee
- ✅ Verified rbee-hive already has audit-logging

**In Progress:**
- 🟡 Wiring audit logger to queen-rbee startup
- 🟡 Wiring audit logger to rbee-hive startup

**Next Steps:**
1. Initialize AuditLogger in queen-rbee main.rs
2. Initialize AuditLogger in rbee-hive main.rs
3. Add audit events to auth middleware
4. Add audit events to worker lifecycle
