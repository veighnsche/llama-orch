# Week 2 Progress: Reliability Features

**Team:** TEAM-114  
**Week:** 2 of 4  
**Goal:** Wire existing libraries, add worker lifecycle features  
**Status:** 🟢 MAJOR PROGRESS

---

## 📋 Tasks Overview

### Priority 1: Wire Audit Logging (1 day)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Add audit-logging dependency to queen-rbee/Cargo.toml
2. ✅ Add audit-logging dependency to rbee-hive/Cargo.toml (already exists!)
3. ✅ Initialize audit logger in queen-rbee startup
4. ✅ Initialize audit logger in rbee-hive startup
5. ✅ Log authentication events (success/failure) in queen-rbee
6. ✅ Log authentication events (success/failure) in rbee-hive
7. ✅ Pass AuditLogger through AppState (both services)
8. ⏳ Log worker spawn/shutdown events (deferred)
9. ⏳ Log configuration changes (deferred)

**Impact:** Compliance features enabled, security audit trail

### Priority 2: Wire Deadline Propagation (1 day)
**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL (queen-rbee done, rbee-hive pending)

**Steps:**
- ✅ Add deadline-propagation dependency to queen-rbee (already exists)
- ✅ Implement deadline helper functions (from_header, to_tokio_timeout, with_buffer)
- ✅ Add deadline extraction and propagation to queen-rbee inference handler
- ✅ Check deadline expiration before processing
- ✅ Use deadline-based timeouts for worker requests
- ⏳ Add deadline headers to rbee-hive → worker requests
- ⏳ Implement timeout cancellation in rbee-hive
- ⏳ Add deadline tracking to worker registry

**Impact:** Timeout handling, better request cancellation

---

### Priority 3: Wire Auth to llm-worker-rbee (1 day)
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE (TEAM-102)

**Steps:**
- ✅ Auth middleware already implemented by TEAM-102
- ✅ Already integrated into worker HTTP routes
- ✅ Tests already present (4 test cases)
- ✅ Worker startup already loads API token

**Impact:** Complete authentication coverage (100%) - ALREADY ACHIEVED

---

### Priority 4: Worker Restart Policy (2-3 days)
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s)
- [ ] Add max restart attempts (default: 3)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker (stop after N failures in M minutes)
- [ ] Track restart count in WorkerInfo (field already exists!)
- [ ] Add restart metrics
- [ ] Test restart scenarios

**Impact:** Resilient workers, automatic recovery

---

## 🎯 Week 2 Goals

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Audit logging active on all components
- [ ] Deadline propagation working end-to-end
- [ ] Authentication on all 3 components (100%)
- [ ] Worker restart policy implemented
- [ ] ~130-150/300 tests passing (43-50%)

**Current Status:**
- Tests passing: ~85-90/300 (28-30%)
- Target: 130-150/300 (43-50%)
- Improvement needed: +45-65 tests

## 📝 Work Log

### 2025-10-19 - TEAM-114

**Completed:**
1. ✅ **Audit Logging (Priority 1)**
   - Initialized AuditLogger in queen-rbee startup (disabled by default)
   - Initialized AuditLogger in rbee-hive daemon startup (disabled by default)
   - Added audit_logger to AppState in both services
   - Added audit events to auth middleware (queen-rbee + rbee-hive)
   - Logs AuthSuccess, AuthFailure with token fingerprints
   - Zero overhead when disabled (home lab mode)

2. ✅ **Deadline Propagation (Priority 2 - Partial)**
   - Implemented deadline helper functions in deadline-propagation crate
   - Added from_header(), to_tokio_timeout(), with_buffer(), as_ms()
   - Wired deadline propagation to queen-rbee /v1/inference endpoint
   - Extracts X-Deadline header or creates default 60s deadline
   - Checks deadline expiration before processing
   - Propagates deadline to worker requests
   - Uses deadline-based timeouts

3. ✅ **Auth to llm-worker-rbee (Priority 3)**
   - Verified already complete by TEAM-102
   - Auth middleware fully implemented and tested
   - 100% authentication coverage achieved

**Compilation Status:**
- ✅ queen-rbee: Compiles successfully
- ✅ rbee-hive: Compiles successfully
- ✅ deadline-propagation: Compiles successfully

**Next Steps:**
1. Add deadline propagation to rbee-hive → worker requests
2. Implement worker restart policy (exponential backoff)
3. Add restart metrics
4. Run integration tests
