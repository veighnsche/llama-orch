## 🚀 How to Use These Checklists

### For Implementation Teams

1. **Read the checklist** for your week
2. **Follow the task order** (priorities are numbered)
3. **Check off tasks** as you complete them
4. **Update progress docs** (WEEK_N_PROGRESS.md)
5. **Create summary** when week complete (WEEK_N_SUMMARY.md)

### For Project Managers

1. **Track progress** using this index
2. **Monitor time estimates** vs actual
3. **Identify blockers** early
4. **Adjust priorities** as needed
5. **Report status** to stakeholders

### For Code Reviewers

1. **Verify task completion** against checklist
2. **Check code quality** criteria
3. **Ensure tests pass**
4. **Review documentation**
5. **Approve for merge**

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well (Week 1)
- ✅ Audit first, fix later (saved 3.5 days)
- ✅ Previous teams did excellent work
- ✅ Production code already follows best practices

### Lessons Learned
1. **Don't assume, verify** - Error handling was already excellent
2. **Check what exists** - Many libraries already implemented
3. **Focus on impact** - Wiring libraries > writing test stubs
4. **Small focused changes** - Easier to verify and debug

### Recommendations
1. **Wire existing libraries** - Don't rebuild what exists
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Copy from working code
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Document as you go** - Easier than retroactive docs

- ✅ All P0 items complete
- ✅ 200+ tests passing (67%+)
