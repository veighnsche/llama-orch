- Pair programming for complex scenarios
- Break into smaller chunks if needed
- Parallel work on independent scenarios

---

### Risk 3: Scope Creep

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Could delay completion  
**Probability:** LOW  
**Mitigation:**
- Stick to existing TODO markers
- No new test scenarios during implementation
- Focus on stub elimination only
- New features go to backlog

---

### Risk 4: Developer Availability

**Impact:** HIGH - Could delay entire plan  
**Probability:** LOW  
**Mitigation:**
- Identify backup developers for each phase
- Cross-train team members
