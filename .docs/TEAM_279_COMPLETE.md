## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Added 6 New Operations

**File:** `bin/99_shared_crates/rbee-operations/src/lib.rs`

**Operations Added:**
1. ✅ `PackageSync` - Sync actual state to match config
2. ✅ `PackageStatus` - Check drift between actual and config
3. ✅ `PackageInstall` - Install all components from config
4. ✅ `PackageUninstall` - Uninstall components
5. ✅ `PackageValidate` - Validate config without applying
6. ✅ `PackageMigrate` - Generate config from current state

### 2. Updated Operation::name() Method

Added name mappings for all 6 operations:
- `package_sync`
- `package_status`
- `package_install`
- `package_uninstall`
- `package_validate`
- `package_migrate`

### 3. Updated Documentation

Updated `should_forward_to_hive()` documentation to clarify:
- Package operations handled by queen (orchestration)
- Worker/Model operations forwarded to hive (execution)
