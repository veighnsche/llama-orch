## 🎯 What Remains in rbee-keeper

### Hive Commands (Still Work)
- ✅ `rbee hive list`
- ✅ `rbee hive start`
- ✅ `rbee hive stop`
- ✅ `rbee hive get`
- ✅ `rbee hive status`
- ✅ `rbee hive refresh-capabilities`

### Worker Commands (Still Work)
- ✅ `rbee worker spawn`
- ✅ `rbee worker process list`
- ✅ `rbee worker process get`

### Model Commands (Unchanged)

## 🚫 What NO LONGER Works

**These commands will fail if user tries them:**
- ❌ `rbee hive ssh-test` - DELETED
- ❌ `rbee hive install` - DELETED
- ❌ `rbee hive uninstall` - DELETED
- ❌ `rbee hive import-ssh` - DELETED
- ❌ `rbee worker binary list` - DELETED
- ❌ `rbee worker binary get` - DELETED
- ❌ `rbee worker binary delete` - DELETED

**Replacement:** TEAM-279 will add:
- 🆕 `rbee sync` (replaces install/uninstall)
- 🆕 `rbee status` (shows drift from config)
- 🆕 `rbee validate` (validates config)

## Files Modified

**Modified:**
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/cli/hive.rs` (-40 LOC)
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/cli/worker.rs` (-10 LOC)
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/cli/mod.rs` (-1 LOC)
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/hive.rs` (-80 LOC)
- `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/worker.rs` (-10 LOC)

**Total Deleted:** ~140 LOC

---

## Next Steps

**TEAM-279 needs to:**
1. Add new package CLI commands to `cli/` directory
2. Add new package handlers to `handlers/` directory
3. Wire up new commands in main.rs

**But first, they must fix queen-rbee and rbee-hive compilation errors.**

---

**rbee-keeper cleanup complete. Ready for new package commands.**
