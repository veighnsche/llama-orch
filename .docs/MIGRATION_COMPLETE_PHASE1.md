# Cloud Profile Migration - Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Milestone**: Foundation Libraries Created and Tested

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented the foundational library architecture for CLOUD_PROFILE deployment. The project now has clear separation between:
- **Control plane libraries** (orchestratord - no GPU required)
- **GPU node libraries** (pool-managerd - GPU required)
- **Shared libraries** (both)

All code compiles, passes unit tests, and is ready for integration into orchestratord and pool-managerd.

---

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Library Organization Structure

Created three-tier organization as documented in `.docs/ARCHITECTURE_LIBRARY_ORGANIZATION.md`:

```
libs/
├── shared/
│   └── pool-registry-types/     ✅ Common types for HTTP communication
├── control-plane/
│   └── service-registry/        ✅ Track GPU nodes, heartbeat monitoring
└── gpu-node/
    ├── handoff-watcher/         ✅ Watch for engine readiness (moved from orchestratord)
    └── node-registration/       ✅ Register with control plane
```

### 2. Shared Types Library (`libs/shared/pool-registry-types`)

**Purpose**: Enable serializable communication between orchestratord and pool-managerd

**Key Types**:
- `HealthStatus` - Pool health tracking
- `NodeInfo` - Complete node metadata
- `NodeCapabilities` - GPU/CPU/RAM info
- `PoolSnapshot` - Pool state for placement

**Tests**: 5 unit tests covering availability checks

### 3. Service Registry (`libs/control-plane/service-registry`)

**Purpose**: orchestratord tracks which GPU nodes are online

**Key Features**:
- `ServiceRegistry::register()` - Add GPU node
- `ServiceRegistry::heartbeat()` - Process heartbeat, mark online
- `ServiceRegistry::check_stale_nodes()` - Detect offline (30s timeout)
- `spawn_stale_checker()` - Background monitoring task
- `get_online_nodes()` - Query for placement

**API Types**:
- `RegisterRequest` / `RegisterResponse`
- `HeartbeatRequest` / `HeartbeatResponse`

**Tests**: 6 unit tests covering registration, heartbeat, and deregistration

### 4. Handoff Watcher (`libs/gpu-node/handoff-watcher`)

**Purpose**: pool-managerd watches local filesystem for engine readiness

**Key Features**:
- `HandoffWatcher::spawn()` - Background polling task
- Watches `.runtime/engines/*.json` (1s interval)
- Callback-based architecture for registry updates
- Prevents duplicate processing

**Migration**: Moved from orchestratord (breaks in cloud) to pool-managerd (local access)

**Tests**: 1 integration test with tempfile

### 5. Node Registration (`libs/gpu-node/node-registration`)

**Purpose**: pool-managerd announces itself to orchestratord

**Key Features**:
- `NodeRegistration::register()` - Startup registration
- `spawn_heartbeat()` - Periodic health reporting (10s)
- `NodeRegistration::deregister()` - Graceful shutdown
- `RegistrationClient` - HTTP client with Bearer token support

**Tests**: 1 unit test for configuration

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before (HOME_PROFILE)
```
Single Machine:
  orchestratord (watches .runtime/engines/*.json)
        ↓ localhost
  pool-managerd (embedded registry)
        ↓ spawns
  engine processes
```

### After (CLOUD_PROFILE Support)
```
Control Plane Node (no GPU):
  orchestratord + ServiceRegistry
        ↓ HTTP + Auth
        ↓
GPU Node 1:
  pool-managerd + HandoffWatcher + NodeRegistration
        ↓ spawns
  engine processes
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Component Naming Convention
- **Control plane node**: Runs orchestratord (CPU-only, coordinates cluster)
- **GPU nodes**: Run pool-managerd (one instance per machine with GPUs)

### 2. Handoff Watcher Relocation
- **Problem**: orchestratord can't access pool-managerd's filesystem in distributed deployment
- **Solution**: Move watcher to pool-managerd, communicate readiness via heartbeat
- **Benefit**: Works across network boundaries

### 3. Service Discovery Pattern
Following `.specs/01_cloud_profile_.md`:
- GPU nodes register on startup: `POST /v2/nodes/register`
- Periodic heartbeat every 10s: `POST /v2/nodes/{id}/heartbeat`
- Graceful deregister on shutdown: `DELETE /v2/nodes/{id}`
- Automatic offline detection: 30s missed heartbeat

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- HOME_PROFILE continues to work (feature flags)
- Libraries can be used in both single-machine and distributed modes
- Gradual migration path

---

## Verification Results

### Compilation
```bash
cargo check -p pool-registry-types -p service-registry \
            -p handoff-watcher -p node-registration
✅ All crates compile successfully
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
cargo test -p pool-registry-types     # 5 tests
cargo test -p service-registry        # 6 tests
cargo test -p handoff-watcher         # 1 test
cargo test -p node-registration       # 1 test
✅ All tests pass
```

### Workspace Integration
- Updated `Cargo.toml` with new workspace members
- Added `chrono` workspace dependency
- Clear comments showing library categories

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate: Integrate into orchestratord (Week 2-3)

**Tasks**:
1. Add `/v2/nodes/*` HTTP endpoints
2. Embed `ServiceRegistry` in `AppState`
3. Spawn stale checker task on startup
4. Update placement logic to query registry
5. Add config flags: `ORCHESTRATORD_CLOUD_PROFILE=false` (default)
6. Update OpenAPI contracts
7. Write integration tests

**Deliverable**: orchestratord can accept node registrations and track online GPU nodes

### Then: Integrate into pool-managerd (Week 3-4)

**Tasks**:
1. Add `HandoffWatcher` on startup
2. Add `NodeRegistration` lifecycle
3. Report pool status in heartbeat
4. Add configuration options
5. Write integration tests

**Deliverable**: pool-managerd registers with orchestratord and reports health

## Team Handoff

**For orchestratord team**:
- Review `libs/control-plane/service-registry/`
- Plan HTTP endpoints: `/v2/nodes/*`
- Consider how to embed registry in `AppState`
- Check OpenAPI contracts need updating

**For pool-managerd team**:
- Review `libs/gpu-node/handoff-watcher/` and `libs/gpu-node/node-registration/`
- Plan main.rs integration points
- Define configuration structure
- Consider systemd service file updates

**For testing team**:
- Plan multi-node E2E test infrastructure
- Consider Docker Compose setup for local testing
- Review chaos testing scenarios
